 POLITICS_GAO_ZONGWU_DESC:0 "만약 중국의 굴욕의 세기의 모습을 단편적으로 보여주는 사람이 있다면 바로 가오중우라고 할 수 있습니다. 청나라의 희미한 빛 속에서 태어난 가오중우는 꼴사납게 그의 삶을 시작했습니다. 기민하지만 연약하고, 만성적인 결핵 투병에 시달리는 일이 잦았던 그의 미래는 일본 유학이라는 특혜로 인해 밝아지기 시작했습니다. 유학을 마치고 난징으로 돌아오자마자, 가오중우는 난징시립대학에서 정치학을 가르쳤습니다. 병약하지만 총명한 이 젊은이는 중일 사이에서 자신의 배경을 활용하여 이 둘의 관계에 있어서는 틀을 깨트리는 존재로 빠르게 명성을 얻었습니다. 그의 중국의 미래에 관한 논문은 결국 장개석 정부의 내부 세력들, 특히 왕징웨이를 단장으로 하는 외교부의 주목을 받았습니다. \n\n 20대까지 가오중우는 외교부의 아시아부문을 이끌었습니다. 일본제국이 루거우차오 사변을 빌미로 공격을 시작했을때, 그는 중국과 일본사이에서 현상유지에 관한 협상을 시도했는데, 이러한 시도는 모두 히로히토 천황의 귀에 거슬리는 행위였습니다. 일본이라는 거대한 전쟁기계는 난징까지 계속 학살과 약탈을 자행하였는데, 그런 모습을 지켜보면서 의기소침해지고 병세가 약화된 가오중우는 관직에서 사임하고 그의 옛스승에게로 도망쳤습니다. \n\n 중국의 꼴사나운 몰락은 새로운 중국의 새로운 후계자 칭호를 위한 권력의 공백을 낳았습니다. 외교관, 입법위원, 장교들이 그 자리를 놓고 권력투쟁을 벌였습니다. 선두주자가 없는 상황에서 결국 이 나이든 외교관이 타협의 산물로서 다시 주목을 받게 되었습니다. 그를 권좌에 올린 사람들은 하나같이 그의 나약함을 이용해 조종하고자 했습니다. 그러나 가오중우는 민주주의에 대한 강한 강조를 하면서 그들의 기대를 저버렸습니다. 그는 더이상 청의 그림자, 장개석의 중국과 그의 스승의 그림자 속에서 살기를 거부했습니다. 큰 목표와 거대한 신발을 채워야하는 상황에서 한 가지의 질문이 남았습니다. 가오는 그의 조국의 현대화를 완수할수 있을까요? 아니면 잿더미가된 과거로만 남을 것인지요?"

 CHI_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "우한에서 청을 상대로 혁명의 도화선에 불을 붙혔던 희망에찬 사람들은 30년만에 일본에 의해 그들의 공화국과함께 충칭에서 장렬한 최후를 맞이하였습니다. 중국의 새로운 공화국 정부는 국민당의 합법적인 후계자임을 주장하곤하지만 실제론 누구든 이것이 거짓부렁에 불과하다는 사실을 잘 알고있습니다. 실제로 1962년의 중화민국은 일본의 식민지나 다름없는 상태로, 일본가정의 식탁에 음식을 올려놓음과 동시에 자원의 착취의 대상일 뿐입니다. 그러나 아직 많은 사람들이 음지에서 빛을 쫒고자 하고, 이러한 상황을 극복할 가능성있다고 생각하는 사람도 있습니다. 중국은 항일전쟁이후로 일본의 경제에대한 투자로 성장해왔으며, 오직 안정과 평화만 알고 있습니다. 아마도 가오종우가 계획한 5대 현대화 계획이 잘만 이루어진다면, 중국이 단순한 굴종자가 되는 것을 넘어서는 방향으로 나아가게 될수도 있을 겁니다."

As the ever innovating world continues to rush past us, hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers are forlorn, left wondering how they will provide for their families.\n\n To combat mass illiteracy and its consequences on the efficiency of the government, Zongwu has issued a general reform of the education system, promising sweeping changes to the country's attitude towards literacy; these reforms will all be encompassed within the modernization program of education.\n\n Gao's offensive against the pathetic educational system comes in a three pronged attack. Firstly, the people must read. Increasing literacy sounds simple enough, but with such a massive and widely dispersed population, ensuring everyone can read will be no easy feat. To ensure that the next generation of Chinese students receive the best education, the reform proposal also calls for hosting intellectuals from Japan. Finally, once students meet the bare minimum of reading and writing, as taught by highly qualified Japanese teachers, we will grant them a revitalized and modern curriculum. The goals set by the proposal seem far fetched but if they can be accomplished they will surely set the stage for a modern China."

We will not follow down the same path of failure.\n\n This inequality remains today, but there is one sector that can be easily remedied; education. If we are to march forward, unified, our children and their children must be given proper education. They will be taught to read and to write, mathematics, and the history of Zhongguo.

An elderly gentleman who introduced himself as Mr. Xuefang gave an impassioned introduction to the children. "Kids, as you know we are in the presence of a tremendous man.

The smell hit him first. Then the pipes dripping water, then the hole in the ceiling. Gao dropped his head and let out a defeated sigh. There was still much work to be done obviously. He made a mental note to add special guidelines for maintaining the property. Despite his visual disappointment, the principal turned and continued to lead the president around the school. Room after room, Gao noted infraction after infraction. The bathrooms were a hotbed for illness, the teachers had no clue what the curriculum was, and students arrived at school hours late, exhausted from walking the entire journey here. \n\n Finally, after all was said and done, Gao returned to his limousine and went over the shortcomings of the school. He drafted a list of guidelines for all schools to meet. Chiefly was sanitation, but below it was providing reasonable transport, convenience, quality education, instilling patriotism, and having properly educated teachers.

The census committee has been given wide reaching authority over our schools, to ensure China's education. First and foremost, China must read.

The dream of universal literacy seems less of a dream and more like reality with each passing day.\n\nA long journey remains, of course, until China can boast a literacy rate similar to that of Japan or America, but the foundation for the future has been laid.

For the first time in Chinese history, one can see citizens from all economic backgrounds reading newspapers, deliberating over street ads, and immortalizing their ideas, thoughts, and beliefs in ink for others to read.\n\nIn a similar fashion, China as a whole has torn off the veil of ignorance and strides bravely into a new age."

Once average citizens, now imbued with the power of written words, have taken it upon themselves to author books about nearly anything and everything.\n\nAlthough these new classics are, understandably, not as-of-yet comparable to Japanese or Western literature, they have become incredibly popular within China and some have even attained foreign recognition and international renown. A notable example is "Orange Rain," an adventure novel written by a rural gardener concerning a man and his monkey's journey to the edge of the world, which has swept like a firestorm though Peruvian literary circles.\n\nIt would appear that the literacy programs, an idea founded upon a dream of a dream, have been widely successful beyond even the most optimistic expectations."

Leaving the office, he slipped into his coat. Behind him a soft voice called out, "Mr. President, are you going to be long?" Gao turned around, visibly startled. "No, no I'll be right back, just have to," the Chinese president cleared his throat, "I just have to clear my head." \n\n  Around him, umbrellas began to pop open as the first raindrops began to fall.

When the rising sun cast it's rays into a divided China, so much was lost, centuries old artifacts simply reduced to rubble.

A week ago, anti-Imperialist graffiti and obscene drawings were found sprinkled along the bottom of the Chinese Mitsubishi offices. As soon as these crude illustrations were found, authorities began to investigate.\n\nAfter raiding numerous homes in the slums, the police charged into a woman's home. The elderly woman, frightened, began to beat the men with sandals. While the officers endured the slight discomfort for a couple of minutes, they eventually knocked the woman out and found stacks of empty spray-paint cans down the stairs, underneath the ground floor. Also down in the basement was a teenager cowering in the corner, shaking. After being shot with rubber bullets, the teenager was dragged out and forced to confess his crimes of disturbing the peace. The liberal skank, the brat that he was, ratted out his accomplices, who were promptly arrested. A military tribune found them guilty and sentenced them to death for treason. The teenagers, who had been rotting in a cell for days, were finally brought to the gallows. One fainted, his knees buckling before stepping up to the rope. The soldiers present shot him in the head. The rest had the noose put around their necks. As the stools were pulled beneath them, most called for their families, or let out a short prayer. One of them, short and rat-faced, had the nerve to make his last words "Fuck the Emperor!"

While Americans have claimed that this addictive factor is not due to the possibility of cocaine in the drink, we can't trust them.\n\nDealing in Coca-Cola or any other dangerous, illicit drugs is severely punished, for even taking a sip could get an innocent child of China addicted.\n\nIt was on the ninth of August that this aforementioned liquid was found in an old country warehouse, about fifty kilometers from Chongqing. A warehouse raid prompted by informants within the triads uncovered boxes upon boxes full of Coca-Cola, opium, marijuana, and every other western, decadent drug under the sun. While the drugs were safely disposed of, more importantly the Coca-Cola was incinerated. As an unfortunate side effect, paranoia is at and all time high, dangerous rumors within the police department have begun to spread.

In the corner of the apartment, a wood burning stove kept her warm and fended off the wind of a winter evening. She pulled out her book, the Adapted Writings of Dr. Sun Yat Sen. The government had been promoting the memoirs as a tool of propaganda and to encourage literacy. Now, to read meant to hear the words of the great forerunner of Chinese republicanism, not just to read signs and sappy romance. Currently, she was reading an annotated version of Sun Yat-Sen's comments on Pan-Asianism. His words, 40 years old, still rung true. A particular line struck her, 'The Kuomintang Doctrine of Nationalism has two implications: the first is the emancipation of the Chinese people, and the second is the equality of all the races within China.'\n\nSomething stirred within her. She wasn't sure how to explain it. A passion for one's nation? An excitement for something great among her people? Never had she felt something like this before, certainly not before she had learned to read. Pride for what China had gone through and was yet to achieve rushed through her.

For the entire province of Henan, Tian and his lazy co-worker sorted through applications for prospective teachers. Some grew up in wealthy Nanjing and Shanghai neighborhoods to nationalistic parents and decided they were destined to help the down and under in the west. Some grew up as peasants, found Jesus, became literate, and naturally walked into education.\n\nWhether rich or poor, religious or not, Tian was indiscriminate; he judged by experience and by compatibility with the job. While his co-worker usually just scanned the paper and signed the authorization, Tian looked at each one with a scrutiny that was probably inappropriate. In the name of pride for his nation, the man worked overtime almost every day.\n\nNights of pouring over applications meant that he returned home in the wee hours of morning with sore eyes and a sense of upholding the security of his nation. His wife complained that he was never around, and always wondered if Tian was secretly a Japanese agent, off doing work in the bars and galas of Zhengzhou. In truth, Tian Xuefeng was just a minor bureaucrat doing great things. On one brisk Tuesday morning, Tian woke up early to get to work. Putting on his cheap jacket and slipping his wire glasses on, he pushed open the door, jumped on his Flying Pigeon, and rode to his job. Walking in with a smile and passion to serve his nation, his boss handed him a paper upon entry. Was Tian finally being rewarded for his national service?

Sorting through the bills by state-owned corporations and the nationalistic propaganda, four were returned college applications. Holding the letters, the key to his freedom, he opened the first for Keio University. It might not have been his first choice, but it was located in the big city, and no doubt was a good pick. Mori was only a little disappointed to find out he had not been accepted. Opening the other two from Japanese universities, Komazawa University and the University of Tokyo, he was again disappointed to find out his rejection. The last letter left to open was from the University of Nanjing. He had read in the news how well the Chinese education system was booming; reports made it seem like the Japanese were a bit jealous of the new Chinese Universities. Mori had decided to apply to the University of Nanjing, being the most prestigious of the universities in China. He had not expected to get in.

It was of typical German design. An impractical size easily targeted by bombers, accompanied with massive fuel costs, meant that it would barely function in battle. A couple heavy mines and a piercing tank bullet could take one of these down in no time. Ping's munitions workshop was perfectly suited to build a mine that could target the soft underbelly of the tank. His workshop, flooded with qualified applications for people who wanted to assist the burgeoning military-industrial complex in China, was not only challenging Japanese designs, but challenging designs cooked up by some of the greatest arms manufacturers in Berlin and Washington. With the assistance of Japanese intelligence, China was able to copy as well as counter technology created by those outside of the sphere. Outside of the obvious military benefit, it meant that factories once producing consumer goods had begun to switch to production of ammunition, guns, and even limited batches of tanks. The business of war was booming, and Ping was in the perfect place to capitalize on it."

He suspected the critics were at the heart of why his book had skyrocketed in popularity. They had planned his book as some kind of great revival of academia in China. The common man and woman had picked it up to show off their worldliness or simply to educate themselves. Never before in Chinese history had a nonfiction book become so popular in such a short amount of time. It's not like Qian's writing was that amazing. He was fine, at best. His best guess at its success was how both the Japanese and Chinese had seized onto it as a propaganda tool, and how it's release coincided with the aftershocks of Chinese educational reform.

Sourcing the food is no problem however, as we put food on the table for most of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

If he does have any limited power or running water, it is entirely locally sourced, often leading to inconvienent arrangements or a lack of arrangements. And so, the Chinese peasant lives without a light to read or water to bathe. Ironically, this regionalist energy infrastructure means we power our oil wells and refinerys with kerosene.\n\nAcross the Yellow Sea, each Japanese citizen lives with power coursing through his home. Their energy grid, a nationally standardized system, produces energy that may be used on the other side of the Empire. Great power lines fly along the shoulders of country roads. This lofty goal, once unthinkable, may now be attainable. By connecting regionalized energy infrastructure, we can replicate Japan's achievements and give every man in China light."

Sure, we can sustain our military's production needs as is but if we wish to expand to facilitate a proper Chinese army, we will need much more in supply. For this reason, we need to get even more out of our population. Not just the workers, who will do their patriotic work, but the consumer as well. Our government has refrained from excess taxation as our populace has not had the means to pay large taxes, but now with the growth of consumerism maybe a sales tax is appropriate."

As long as a Chinese soldier wields a even a Japanese canteen we have not produced enough. We face the issue of quantity and need to fix our shortage as soon as possible. We shall remedy this, quite ingeniously might I add, by lengthening work hours, opening more production hubs, and introducing quotas to the factories. If our math is correct, and it usually is, we should see production increase near-exponentially!"

 chi.68.d:0 "Our system of building factory campuses has worked out well so far, but even now it is not enough. Workers spend almost all of their time living on the campus, working long hours and returning back to their bunks to sleep. But this is not enough. We need even more workers to make even more guns.

China had known only fighting, both internal and external, and ironically only through defeat could China finally grow. It is by no means a favorable relationship, but our ties with the Japanese have allowed access to the their stockpile of second-hand industrial tooling. These poorly maintained antiques have worked for us up until now, but if we wish to truly industrialize we will need a more substantial supply-base. Recently, an envoy from Tokyo has delivered an offer: a certain zaibatsu is willing to sign an exclusive contract with our government for the production of heavy industrial equipment in exchange for favorable resource rights in one of our northern provinces. Not only would this deal provide us with much needed equipment, it would also employ many of our citizens and encourage much needed prosperity amongst the peasantry, though at the risk of concession to Japan. We must tread lightly."
 chi.69.a:0 "Is this our chance?"

 chi.70.t:0 "Free the Fields"
 chi.70.d:0 "If we ever wish to compete with the Japanese, we need to speed up our industrialization. Our Republic's primary roadblocks with industrialisation have been a lack of access to modern production machinery and limited access to a skilled workforce. The Japanese have offered us a mission of "industrial advisors" to oversee our transition, however, these agreements include many caveats that would turn China into a zaibatsu playground. It has been theorized by one of our economic ministers that if we can successfully mechanize our agrarian industry, it would be possible to transfer semi-skilled laborers from rural farms into urban factories. Our fledgling urban industry is in dire need of qualified working people and, by offering incentives to those recently jobless farmers, is quite accessible to us. We will of course have to subsidize the acquisition of mechanized farming equipment for these farmers but what are a few tractors in the name of national progress? "
 chi.70.a:0 "Wagons east!"

 chi.71.t:0 "A Hardworking People"
 chi.71.d:0 "Up and down China the mechanical hums and clanks of industry sound out. In such a short amount of time, we have expanded our resource exploitation, bolstered our energy production, all to fuel our militarization campaign. Now, Chinese factories produce more arms, more food, more planes, more than ever before. But this is not enough. To ensure long term prosperity we must instill a virtue of hard work and devotion to progress in our culture."
 chi.71.a:0 "Only China can control her future!"

 chi.72.t:0 "An Industrial System"
 chi.72.d:0 "All across China, we have fostered groupings of powerful industrial communities. Whether they provide resources, arms, electricity, or consumer products, they all are working with incredible efficiency for the betterment of China. Now, just one issue remains: linking all the industrial communities into one cohesive system. This, however, should be no problem. All of our industry exists either directly on or adjacent to a tributary for the Yangtze river. Previously an avenue for Western imperialists to access our interior trade network, it will now serve as our industrial highway until a more robust transportation system is available."
 chi.72.a:0 "The Yangtze will feed us all!"

 chi.73.t:0 "The Burden of Success"
 chi.73.d:0 "A decade ago, China was called the "breadbasket of the Sphere". To the Japanese, our agrarian economy was of particular use and they remain consistent customers to our millet and rice exports. Even then, our production was such that the Japanese men in Hawaii ate their bento over Chinese grown rice, much the same as the Japanese youth growing up on Chinese rice in their porridge. The Japanese would eat our beef, drink our tea, crack our eggs, and slice our bread. We have long controlled the Sack, it is what made us useful to the Japanese, but now we are forging our Sword.\n\nPickaxes, now made in China, crack against iron. Furnaces smelt the iron, technicians turn it to steel, and ferrymen ship tons of the metal out to factories. The lights never go out now, as coal and oil burn to keep the night alive. It is easy, even affordable, for a peasant to turn the lights on at night and teach themselves to read after a long day's worth of work. Factories turn resources into products useful for China's efforts at an incredible rate. Workers from all around the country stay in dormitories and work day in and out for national progress. Soldiers now shoot Chinese guns, ride Chinese bikes, and travel on Chinese busses. What is even more amazing still is the fact that this entire process can now occur without a word of Japanese spoken. In this sense, we are becoming free.\n\nNow we hold the Japanese in a precarious situation. Their food is Chinese and soon their appliances will be too. The Japanese government in Shanghai is taking protectionist measures, limiting Chinese industrial export traffic and keeping a closer eye on how much we're actually exporting. This is no issue, however, simply the burden of success."
 chi.73.a:0 "To China, stronger than ever!"

 chi.74.t:0 "메이드 인 차이나"
 chi.74.d:0 "A boy rides his bike down the beaten muddy trails of Luzon. It is not a new bike, but it works. He received it for his birthday. He is happy. Underneath the seat "Made in China" is pressed into the steel.\n\nThe village watch nurses a beer as he looks out into the jungles of Borneo. In his lap he cradles a hunting rifle. He likes it because it is reliable and hardly misses. Carved into the stock is "Made in China".\n\nIn the Tokyo Mitsukoshi, an impatient husband waits for his wife to decide on a new rice cooker. She is torn between two, one red and one blue. She does not want to buy something that will break after a few months' usage. It does not matter which one she choses, as both are stamped "Made in China"\n\n.A conductor on the Thai-Burma Link Railway smokes his cigarette as he watches the engine dials. The boiler could use a bit more heat, so he signals the engineer to shovel some more coal in. The shovel, the coal, and the engine were all Made in China."
 chi.74.a:0 "Let it be known."

 chi.75.t:0 "Opportunity at the Port of Dailian."
 chi.75.d:0 "The ships arrived along the shore, carrying with them our hopes and dreams of a renewed China. Teachers, by the hundreds or thousands arrived, intent on teaching potential labourers for their 'sphere of co-prosperity', or whatever idealistic truthism we schmoozed those Japanese diplomats with. Little do any of them know of what potential these men will be to our greater plan, little do those distant slave masters know of our final goal."
 chi.75.a:0 "A step for the state, a leap for our nation."

 chi.76.t:0 "New Methods"
 chi.76.d:0 ""It's my turn to play! Wei, you're a big idiot!" Lui Xian stamped his feet, tears pooling up in his eyes. The child's classmate paid little attention to the pouts of the young Chinese boy and kept playing, oblivious. The frustration of being ignored built up in Lui, his unbridled rage climaxing with him smacking the girl upside the head.\n\nKaito adjusted her glasses nervously as she flicked through the ginormous stack of papers plopped upon her desk. Kaito loved teaching, it was what she was born to do, and she wanted to do something good for those who need it most. Combining her aspirations and moving to rural China seemed like the obvious answer. Her idealistic passion may have clouded her judgment, this was not what she had envisioned. Kaito was brought back to reality from a nightmarish screech from the back of the classroom.\n\n"LUI HIT ME! Ms. Teacher, Lui hit me!" Kaito took a deep breath and put on a soft smile. "Now now, everyone, we are all friends here. Would you look at the time, I think it's time we all learned each other's names! Why don't you go first, young lady?"\n\nThe schoolgirl wiped her eyes and nodded, walking up to the chalkboard. Slowly and shakily, something that resembled Wei began to take shape on the chalkboard. When she was done, a chorus of "My turn!" and "I can do it better!" erupted from the classroom. Kaito leaned against a wall, her smile now genuine, maybe it wouldn't be so bad after all."
 chi.76.a:0 "We entrust our children to our friends."

 chi.77.t:0 "Cooperation With The Japanese Intellectuals"
 chi.77.d:0 "We strive to become a sovereign nation, a shining light of the Eastern Hemisphere, however, there's no chance of us being able to do this without our modernization programs, specifically that of education and reunification, which we will need to be spearheaded by our overlords in Japan. In return for their logistical, intellectual, and foundational support we will provide them with the resources as they request."
 chi.77.a:0 "A little help is all that we need."

 chi.78.t:0 "Overseeing the Teaching"
 chi.78.d:0 "The Japanese teachers we were able to acquire are now being monitored by our own native curriculum, to root out any deceitful charlatans who might tarnish the education given with indoctrinating biases or influences. It will also be an opportunity to ensure that the good Chinese culture is being mantained and kept alive, rather than left to whither and die like what is happing in Korea or pratically all of Europe."
 chi.78.a:0 "Imperialism shall never be distilled in our youth! Well, just not too much imperialism."

 chi.79.t:0 "동등한 노동"
 chi.79.d:0 "Instructors from both Japan and China now collaborate for the higher purpose of bringing our intellectually starving populace to a better future refined in humanities and sciences. We work with them for the material, administrative, and ecnomically collective prosperity for all of the Co-Prosperity sphere."
 chi.79.a:0 "Alone we are weak, together we are strong."

 chi.80.t:0 "Encourage Intellectuals"
 chi.80.d:0 "We are at the point in which we can nuture, raise, and encourage our own intellectuals who will assist us as we venture into the complete modernization and reform of China with grace and excellency. Foreign intellectuals will still work with us, however, they will no longer be exclsuive in their pursuits and we will now monitor our reliance on them."
 chi.80.a:0 "To think is to be."

 chi.81.t:0 "Great Minds"
 chi.81.d:0 "Scarcely a few centuries ago, China dominated the intellectual world, with the powers of Europe and the West failing to come close to our splendor and majesty of our lands, until the Renaissance caused them to lurch ahead. Striving to return to these times, we implented courses teaching and building upon what was once revolutionary from the great philosophers, just like the West."
 chi.81.a:0 "We don't just think alike, but higher."

 chi.82.t:0 "Promote Higher Education"
 chi.82.d:0 "We no longer live in the era in which one man can be a polymath in every subject and is able to study and discover the hidden secrets of the limitless breadths of knowledge. More colleges, universities, and opportunities for higher education has been established, and soon anyone will be able to excel in their field of study beyond what is mandated by the state."
 chi.82.a:0 "Perhaps its time for us to go back to school..."

 chi.86.t:0 "Reorganizing the Curriculum"
 chi.86.d:0 "We are in the process of updating the subjects taught at schools to reflect the realities of the modern world. New methods of teaching, decades old in developed nations, have been implemented. Lessons, once nothing but antiquated parables and musings, have been standardized. Children, who once wasted time socializing and playing games on the street, now spend their carefully partitioned days lugging textbooks in between classrooms organized into rows of desks, full of anxiety over assignments and exams."
 chi.86.a:0 "Class is in session."

 chi.87.t:0 "Technical Subjects"
 chi.87.d:0 "We have started out our reforms with the teaching of subjects related to technology and industrialization. By teaching the operation of machinery, creative solutions to technical issues, and how to properly conduct repairs, our populace will become world-class workers."
 chi.87.a:0 "The factories sure seem to be a lot more advanced these days..."

 chi.88.t:0 "Culture Studies"
 chi.88.d:0 "A new subject has been added to the national Chinese curriculum but, to the confusion and even anger of many instructors and students, it does not concern China at all! For the first time, the youth are encouraged to examine and understand foreign cultures besides the Japanese. Alien literature, film, and music is studied in classrooms across the country, giving our people a greater appreciation for the other"
 chi.88.a:0 "What is a 'Cowboy'?"

 chi.89.t:0 "Teach Math"
 chi.89.d:0 "We have reformed the Mathematics curriculum, now with an enhanched emphasis on growth and specialization. Teachers are now given more updated courses, and now use techniques to ensure everyone is able to understand the fundamentals. We are sure to produce administrators, bureaucrats, engineers, and many others that will serve the State and the sciences quite excellently."
 chi.89.a:0 "How can anyone remember anything past Algebra?"

 chi.90.t:0 "Nationalism in Learning"
 chi.90.d:0 "China has existed as a nation for three thousand years. For two thousand and seven hundred of these years we were the center of the Earth, and our culture, sciences, and technology were so far ahead of the rest of the world that all others threw themselves down at our heavenly feet for a mere taste of our divine luxury afforded by none other than ourselves. But for three hundred of them we lurked in the shadows, subservient to those in Europe or now, to Japan. What reason could there possibly be to not be proud of the prosperity, rather than submission? None, absolutely no. Therefore, we will now dedicate ourselves to reform the curriculum in all subjects, but most importantly History, to instill senses national pride and great élan within the impresionable youth so that they may see the dream we hold, and make them more pliable towards our reforms for the betterment of all nations of China."
 chi.90.a:0 "The mandate of heaven rests in all of us."

 chi.91.t:0 "A Field Trip in Tsinghua"
 chi.91.d:0 ""Now, I want you to take a closer look at the weave on this."\n\nThe students pushed into each other, taking frantic notes and sketches. There was no cushion. Instead, there was a mat of tightly woven fibers, so fine as to evade the human eye. Above the fibers, on a headrest, was a varnish relief of Chinese life. A maid carried a vase to the well. A bureaucrat strode through town, his mouth agape with laughter. It was a beautiful work of art.\n\n"Could anyone guess the period that this seat was produced in?"\n\nIn a moment, a student raised her hand.\n\n"Yes?"\n\n"Well, judging by the weave on the fiber, i'd say late Qing?"\n\n"In fact, you might be surprised to know that this dates back far, far earlier. Early Ming."\n\nThe students gasped. Perhaps pre-Manchu artistic tradition was far more advanced then they had thought."
 chi.91.a:0 ""Look at those mountains! Just amazing...""

 chi.92.t:0 "Teach the Sciences"
 chi.92.d:0 "The sciences: chemistry, biology, and physics, previously neglected, have been thoroughly integrated into every level of education. Young children now perform rudimentary experiments in classrooms and set to work creating CO2 bubbles, measuring the speed of falling marbles, dissecting frogs, and, most importantly, becoming infected with the desire to know. These young minds, inundated with science, will be the vanguard of China's future."
 chi.92.a:0 "Knowledge grows from the mouth of a test tube."

 chi.93.t:0 "Teach History"
 chi.93.d:0 "The history of the Oriental world is lengthly, epic, and teaches lessons all can follow, however, we need to also teach the evolutions of Europe and the turmoils of the United States, allowing our populace to assess all situations that we will be faced with, and be able to provide inspired solutions echoing the great figures of the world prior the present."
 chi.93.a:0 "Let's pray we aren't doomed to repeat it..."

 chi.94.t:0 "Breakthroughs in the Sciences"
 chi.94.d:0 "Our science programs have paid off, with our population not just becoming explemary at its studies but also researching and discovering new concepts that can surely be used domestically and militaristically. We welcome these revolutions with open arms."
 chi.94.a:0 "So quantum mechanics aren't just a waste of time now?"

 chi.95.t:0 "Evolution of Culture"
 chi.95.d:0 "The fundamental base of all humanities, whether art or history, is culture. As such, the evolution of culture has become the most crucial aspect of modern Chinese education. Covering the development of artistic style, sociological intersection and diffusion, and the complex zeitgeists of the both the Orient and Occident, this new curriculum will birth an academia unparalleled by any other.\n\nA new age of the arts is upon us!"
 chi.95.a:0 "Historia est vitae magistra."

 chi.96.t:0 "Chinese Scholarship"
 chi.96.d:0 "At long last, we have graduated from Japanese tutelage. Our academic reputation within the Sphere has advanced by leaps and bounds. Yesterday, we were seen as idiots, good only for growing rice. Today, we draw the envy of all Sphere nations for the intellectual capabilities of our students, the rigorous intensity of our schools, and our tireless devotion towards the accumulation of knowledge. We no longer require borrowed Japanese labor to educate our people. In fact, one day they will need us. We have achieved intellectual self sufficiency; Our students learn to teach the next generation. Our horizon, like our knowledge, is boundless."
 chi.96.a:0 "The greatest liberation is that of the mind!"

 chi.97.t:0 "A New Generation of Bright Minds"
 chi.97.d:0 "The Modernization of Chinese education is progressing by leaps and bounds. Already, the next generation of young Chinese citizens is enjoying education standards which had seemed unthinkable just a few years prior. Those who graduate from our reformed institutions are already beginning to make great contributions to the sciences, to culture and the arts, to politics and philosophy.\n\nThough the need for intellect is great in nearly all fields within China, we can attempt to make selective amendments to our curricula and to our teaching methods, thus encouraging greater interest in a specific field for the betterment of our nation. We have identified three possible fields which could benefit greatly from an influx in professionals, namely the natural sciences for scientific research, the political and bureaucratic intelligentsia for developing the means of national government, and the technical subjects to further advance industrial efficiency."

 chi.123.t:0 "The Conference: Four Men Enter"
 chi.123.d:0 "These Nanjing conference rooms had played host to countless low-level bureaucrats. Those from insignificant backgrounds, with no hope of climbing any administrative ladder. The women and the ethnic minorities, poor men without the networks necessary to climb a brutal system. All had walked into the room with a certain hopelessness that was distinctly Chinese. They gave presentations on new ambulances in Pukuo district or on the construction of new residences in Chuzhou. Usually, the viewers of the presentation were unimpressed. Some voted no on whatever project was being presented. Some voted yes. It hardly mattered, nor did they care much. What did it matter?\n\nToday, however, was different. Four true giants walked into the conference room. A breeze whistled through the solitary window. Gao Zongwu shivered. Today was everything. It was the day that China's future would be laid bare, decided by men that were all-too-human, men with uncertain loyalties and even more uncertain motives.\n\nThe four men gathered, sitting around the table. Gao had planned for an extravagant event; a real conference, maybe something less disastrous then the one Manchukuo had put together a few years ago. The War in the South had put that to rest. China needed direction, and fast. So Gao called his old friend Zhou Fohai, and his new friend Jiang Zemin. Finally, he requested a time with Secretary Chen Gongbo.\n\nOne of two options was clear. China would die, or it would liberate the Eastern Continent. Now, all there was to do was decide which."
 chi.123.a:0 "Gao took a deep breath."

 chi.124.t:0 "The Conference: Domestic Policy"
 chi.124.d:0 "The Three Modernizations transformed China. The Sick Man of Asia, bereft of dignity after a century of humiliation, turned itself into the breadbasket of a billion men and women. A divided and sickly nation became robust and industrious, ridding itself of corruption. The power of revolutionary change was made clear. However, China is in many ways still a broken nation. Workers still struggle to make ends meet. Pollution has choked the natural beauty of our nation. Perhaps most importantly, the rural folk still live under a semi-feudalist system of land ownership. Landlords dominate farms and subject tenants to what is practically slavery. It was Sun Yat-Sen's dream to free the peasants of servitude. It is a dream that has withered. The "land to the tiller" ideal is dead. Squallor is the terrible norm.\n\nGao explained his concerns. If Zhongguo was to tackle the great issues of her time, and become the world power it must be, she would have to evolve. Not evolve just in the matters of education, or industry. She would have to build great new monuments to energy and society. Reform systems that had been in place since the birth of China.\n\nChen Gongbo shot back with a steely glare. China needs change. It needs change which is gradual, and conducted in cooperation with neighbors. It could tackle land reform, but slowly and with respect to both landlord and tenant. It could build monuments, but those within reason. It could change politics, but using old methods of money and coercion. Only then could China move forward. Idealism can not guide idealism. Only pragmatism can guide idealism."

 chi.125.t:0 "The Conference: Military Policy"
 chi.125.d:0 "China's military remains weak. Its equipment is designed in Japan and produced in the great arsenals in Hanyang. Soldiers are poorly trained and officers are educated in military universities that are shadows of their state in the old republican era. Even with reforms spearheaded by members of the Legislative Yuan and Gao himself, it is no match for an uncertain world.\n\nGao was worse educated on matters of the military then most of the upper crust in China. His bread and butter was economic reform, not the production of ammunition and the murder of men. Even with his limited knowledge he was aware that reform was desperately needed. Jiang Zemin chimed in with his opinion.\n\nThe old doctrines, in Jiang's view, were dead. They had been rendered obsolete by weapons that could obliterate cities in a second, machines that roared across the sky at unimaginable speeds. There was no point in clinging to old doctrines in such a brave new world. New theorists of war, and new universities, must guide China's armies to victory.\n\nChen Gongbo, for the first time, seemed to consider the words of his rival. Perhaps they agreed on something, for once. Zhou did not. The methods of the past, whether they be of the 19th century or of Sun Tzu's time, still held true. Technology may not be constant, but human nature was so. Why should they change strategies that relied on the failings of man? It was the one pillar on which they could lean."

 chi.126.t:0 "The Conference: Unity"
 chi.126.d:0 "The illusion of Chinese unity was just that: an illusion. It had been so for most of her history. Revolutions and revolts had rocked the nation for the entirety of history. For much of its history, China was composed of warring states, nothing more than personal fiefdoms engaged in eternal wars. Through the millenia, the emperor had been limited by traditions and institutions. Only when confronted by great national tragedies does China seem to unite. Those few great historical dramas pulled together the disparate despots, from the desert to the Yellow River Basin, and united them under one banner, even if only for a few months. Now, a new national drama approached - the inevitable confrontation with Japan. All had come to agree that Japanese hegemony must end. Even Chen Gongbo, vanguard of Pan-Asianism, admitted. China could now only gain true prosperity through liberation. An independent China, true freedom, was the only choice.\n\nGao proposed a new United Front. The second had briefly reared its head only to die in the ruins of Chongqing. The first had completed its goal but fell apart immediately afterwards. This one was to last, not only guaranteeing freedom from Japanese aggression but true solidarity among the five races. Warlords would point their weapons away from each other and towards the common enemy that threatened their very basis of existence. New offices would be formed in the name of courting warlords. Bribes would have to be made, and delegations would be sent. In the name of liberation, China would reach out to the feuding states of Asia, and bring them together. Gao Zongwu explained that this was the only option to freedom."

 chi.157.t:0 "Out with the Old"
 chi.157.d:0 "The Chinese state is one of intense resource production and of intense poverty. For years, Japanese Zaibatsus have stolen our own resources in full view of corrupt politicans. Small Chinese resource extractors and contractors are bought up for measly sums and monopolies are maintained with little to no oversight. While the resources are there for the taking, Chinese industries lack the capabilities to effectively extract these resources and then put them to good use. It is of paramount importance to the progressing industrialization of China that we begin licensing and purchaing equipment from Japan in order to finally extract these materials that exist in our homeland."
 chi.157.a:0 "We seek Yamato quality."

 chi.158.t:0 "Japanese Jackhammers"
 chi.158.d:0 "Today we are happy to say that the Japanese have accepted our deal for the acquisition of excavation equipment! In all, we purchased enough so that we can begin to train our workers in excavation but also keep enough in reserve for reverse engineering. If all keeping according to plan, in mere years we will have the capability to produce our own, Chinese made excavation equipment!"
 chi.158.a:0 "To the Future!"

 chi.159.t:0 "An Expensive Swindle"
 chi.159.d:0 "The papers had been signed. The toasts had been drinked, and the farewells given out freely. All there was now was to wait for the shipment. We held high hopes, and had paid high amounts of money for this equipment. When it arrived in those rusting boats, we learned a lesson: the Japanese are not to be trusted.\n\nDisembarking from the ship, the equipment was revealed to be outdated, poorly maintained trucks, and rusted containers of "supplemental tools". These tools were anything but, ranging from ball peen hammers to old broken personal cameras. While our protests were raised instantly, the Japanese walked past us like we were a beggar on the street. In typical Japanese fashion, they provided a curt bow, boarded the ship, and left with barely a word. Now, we're left with nothing but some angry clients and broken equipment.

 chi.160.d:0 "The elevator rattled as Su Chun descended, as if it was teetering on the edge of disaster. The coal dusted his eyes and seeped into his nails. Yet Su Chun smiled. For this elevator that sunk deep into China was not made by the Japanese. It was designed here in China, for Chinese workers, on Chinese soil. Top quality work, at that. And the coal that ran through his veins was Chinese coal, destined for China. The walls around him; Chinese, and the shaft below him the same. While Chinese mines were once the pity of the mining industry, they are now the envy. They descended five-hundred feet from surface to bottom, full of hardy workers eager to serve their family and nation, using equipment that cut through rock and coal like butter. "

 chi.161.d:0 "It would seem not even the hard work can strike through these layers upon layers of rock. At our deepest, we've fallen just short of 300 meters but the problems haven't stopped. Cave-ins, careless deaths, machine failure, and reckless mining techniques have resulted in weeks of setbacks. We have lost countless pieces of crucial excavation equipment and will have to restock if we wish to continue digging deeper. Until then, all we can do is learn."

 chi.162.t:0 "Gold!"
 chi.162.d:0 "As our engineers cleared the last of the rubble they were greeted with the glorious luster of gold!

 chi.163.t:0 "Fool's Gold"
 chi.163.d:0 "It would appear that our methods of demolition are quite effective, however our scouting could use some work. This particular gold vein that we chose to inaugurate the mines at Henan so happened to form in close proximity to a coal mine, so when our prospectors began to blow our shafts into the rock we received a bigger explosion than we expected. We may now have surface access to the gold vein, but at what cost?"

It was not easy, and it was certainly not cheap, but we now have access to a stable supply of copper all to ourselves."
 chi.164.a:0 "With this, we are powerful!"

 chi.165.t:0 "Copperhead"
 chi.165.d:0 "Below the surface of the Jiangxi hills lies a massive operation of mineshafts sprawling out in all directions. This is our largest mining operation yet, so large in fact that we opted to build a series of smelters on-site to clear congestion on our railways. It was a combination of inexperienced workers and hasty construction that lead to the initial accident when a large bucket of copper sulfide collapsed and flooded the refinery floor. Many workers on the floor received debilitating burns, some even collapsing into the molten mess and never being seen again. Soon the mess would be cleaned by emergency crews, but the damage to our production schedule had been dealt."

Iron is perhaps the most important resource we must secure for exploitation in large quantities. Our government's surveys have found that Hunan holds a variety of resources with iron being the most prominent. If we can establish a mining complex in the area, we will have access to a near-limitless supply of iron, all under Chinese control!"
 chi.166.a:0 "Fire up those furnaces!"

 chi.167.t:0 "A Die Cast!"
 chi.167.d:0 "The facility at Hunan has grown into a beast of its own, a city tucked within the valley of hills sustaining the mine workforce. As one approaches on the main access roads, a faint hum grows into the steady beating of pickaxes and the buzzing of recently employed mechanical drills. This is the environment we have created, a truly vast site estimated to produce millions of tonnes of Iron annually. So impressive even that site security has intercepted Japanese gawkers on "Sunday strolls", no doubt jealous of the growing Chinese industrial strength."
 chi.167.a:0 "If you must look, then behold!"

 chi.168.t:0 "Ironic."
 chi.168.d:0 "It was a Tuesday morning, the fog was low, not all the workers had arrived yet. The furnaces had been going for about an hour now, processing the first cart's load of ore as usual. The iron extraction facility at Hunan was a monsterous construction and possessed multiple on-site smelting facilities to service the various mining departments. The foreman was making his rounds, inspecting the machinery and checking in with his staff. He was a kind, jovial soul, one the workers enjoyed the company of and would work harder for. He would trip, stumbling over the rail and into the bucket of molten iron below. He wouldn't have the time to scream as he disintegrated into the crucible. His death will not be the last in the name of Chinese progress."
 chi.168.a:0 "All of China's sons have mothers."

 chi.169.t:0 "Tons of Tin"
 chi.169.d:0 "Our prospectors went first, digging with dynamite until we had multiple shafts leading to the deposits. Then the engineers, building supports and affixing lights. Soon, miners were chipping away at the tin deposits deep underground. As the mine expands, we introduce more and more machinery, demonstrating that Chinese industry is a modern, capable force. Before long, the mine will produce thousands of tons of tin and our foodstuff industry will prosper."
 chi.169.a:0 "Cans, flying off the shelves!"

 chi.170.t:0 "Tin"
 chi.170.d:0 "As we tried to exploit the Dachang tin deposit our inexperience with excavation showed itself. First, our prospectors blew shafts using dynamite, injuring 4. Then the engineers began affixing supports and lights, which promptly collapsed and required extra time to redo. Once the miners entered another collapse occurred, killing 3 and injuring 22. Left with only 2 functional mine shafts, our expedition into Dachang isn't as successful as we expected."
 chi.170.a:0 "Perhaps we were too greedy?"

 chi.171.t:0 "The Aluminium of Jinan"
 chi.171.d:0 "We now possess great access to resources we previously relied on the Japanese for and now could supply our own current military. But it is not enough to be satisfied with status quo, we must look towards the future and develop materials to expand our armed forces. Aluminium built the bombers that dropped the atomic bomb on Hawaii, it builds the frames for Japan's cars, and is the material of the future if we wish to stand independent. The process of refining Aluminium is a difficult one and will require new tooling and techniques if we wish to successfully begin production, but innovation has no price!"
 chi.171.a:0 "Do not try this at home."

 chi.172.t:0 "Metals of the Future!"
 chi.172.d:0 "Aluminium is no simple material like iron or tin. No, aluminium requires a more deft touch, one with precise machinery and expertise that proved troublesome even for our Japanese "partners". Lanzhou Bauxite Mine has turned out to be a magnificent success, with the new facility hosting a mine, a refinery, and a school to teach technicians for future plants. Already our facility is projected to produce tens of thousands of tonnes of aluminium, perfect for strengthening our military."
 chi.172.a:0 "Light as wood but strong as steel!"

 chi.173.t:0 "These Birds Cannot Fly"
 chi.173.d:0 "Lanzhou Bauxite Mine has made the first shipment of aluminium to the Nanchang Aero assembly plant in Wuhan, marking the first occasion Chinese aluminium will be used to manufacture a Chinese aircraft. At the plant, the aluminium was found to be defective, with too much carbon weakening the sheets to the point of unusability. A second order was requested but this is still embarrassing and shows that we still have a long way to go if we wish to become competitive."
 chi.173.a:0 "Cracking under pressure."

 chi.174.t:0 "Innocent Eyes"
 chi.174.d:0 ""Mother, what are they doing over there?" She tugged on her mother's sleeve, the clangs and bangs of construction had caught her attention. "That's where the factories used to be, remember? Everyday those big men would march straight into those buildings and not come out till sunset. Whatever happened to those people?" The mother flashed her child a warm smile and nudged her away from the business district, "Well honey, they don't work there anymore. The family that used to own that land got bought out by someone else, but that is none of our business." Despite the daughter's resistance, she continued to push her back on the path to their house.\n\n\"So where do they work now?"\n\nThe mother sighed and looked her child in the eyes, brushing her out of the way, "They probably don't have a job right now."\n\n"Awesome! I'd love it if you never had to go to work! We could stay together all day!""
 chi.174.a:0 ""Yes, now come along dear, we must get home.""

 chi.175.t:0 "The worst days of my life"
 chi.175.d:0 "Mother, I hated those factories. Me and the rest of the kids would work from dawn to dusk and when we weren't working, Lin would sneak in his father's alcohol. The iron for guns was feeble and the copper for headlights was impure. I would do my best to work with these things but I would still be blamed. Can't they shout at the metal, not the man?"
 chi.175.a:0 "I am glad I am no longer young."

 chi.176.t:0 "The Fruit of our Efforts"
 chi.176.d:0 "Our attempts to educate our population are paying off, with our literacy rate climbing slowly, but steadily. More and more educated and eager students leave our educative facilities every day, eager to apply their newfound knowledge in the many different workplaces our country has to offer."
 chi.176.a:0 "Recruit them for state service."
 chi.176.b:0 "Let them fill up the empty spaces in employment."

 chi.177.t:0 "Liquifying Coal"
 chi.177.d:0 "In terms of sheer resources, China stands unparalleled. No other nation is scattered with so much potential energy practically seeping out of the rocks. Yet, we lack access to oil, that black gold. In the case we lose Japanese trade and their subsequent access to oil, we must have a fall-back to keep our industries chugging. During the war, German scientists pioneered a method where coal is compressed into liquid form and functions similar to a heavier kerosine. If the procedure is done incorrectly, it can very easily result in loss of life, and it's extremely inefficient. After gaining access to the oil fields of the Caucasus, the Germans entirely stopped using this complex method. We have little choice, however. Oil synthesizing with the help of weathered German advisors is to begin immediately."
 chi.177.a:0 "How does one even compress coal?"

 chi.178.t:0 "The Refinery at Jinan"
 chi.178.d:0 "At first, the sight of wire towers on the outskirts of Jilan seems odd, out of place even for the moderately urbanized city in central Shandong. The framework of towers became structured and now the towers are the centerpiece to a massive synthetic fuel operation located on the Jinan Coal Mine campus. With these refineries operating efficiently, any stoppage in our oil supply will not disrupt our war machine."
 chi.178.a:0 "It's better to be safe than sorry."

 chi.179.t:0 "Explosive Compression"
 chi.179.d:0 "The process of compressing coal is an essential part of the liquidization scheme and has potential to be very dangerous. Our German scientists were expats; many of them barely remembered how to use the machinery required. Fortunately, we recieved documents from our Japanese "partners" for outrageous prices. Evidently, these documents and our German expats have not proved to be enough information to successfully compress coal.\n\nAs the sun set on a Jinan refinery, an explosion of massive proportions could be seen from a kilometer away. The fireball finally dimmed, the stars above were revealed, and emergency services rushed in. Among the rubble and rust of the refinery, 59 workers were killed and many left with crippling injuries. "
 chi.179.a:0 "We knew that progress could not come without suffering."

 chi.180.t:0 "Southern Rubber"
 chi.180.d:0 "It is impossible to facilitate a modern military order of battle without rubber. The icky, thick rubbery sap does little in its natural form, but when refined rubber can serve many roles in the military structure. It is for this reason that, upon Japan's victory in the Pacific war, the rubber fields in the south were given as an exclusive harvesting concession to a Japanese conglomerate. If we could somehow weasel ourselves out of this deal, we could perhaps have access to this rich source of sappy gold."
 chi.180.a:0 "Get the taps ready!"

 chi.181.t:0 "Rubber Runs Thick!"
 chi.181.d:0 "One of the concessions given to China in the postwar period was the empowerment of the Chinese state with the separation of Chinese law from the Japanese system. Given that Japan technically recognizes us a sovereign "partner state", our laws apply on our soil, no matter who it is that does what. It was on this premise that one of our "labor inspectors" dropped in on a few of the Japanese rubber plantations to observe labor conditions. What the inspector found did not please him and, following reports of multiple violations of Chinese labor laws, the plantation is being shut down. The fees we have pushed onto the Japanese conglomerate outweigh that land value and, in a legal deal for "fee forgiveness", we have acquired rights to the fields."
 chi.181.a:0 "Know your rights!"

 chi.182.t:0 "What Runs Thicker?"
 chi.182.d:0 "One of the concessions given to China in the postwar period was the empowerment of the Chinese state with the separation of Chinese law from the Japanese system. Given that Japan technically recognizes us a sovereign "partner state", our laws apply on our soil, no matter who it is that does what. It was on this premise that one of our "labor inspectors" dropped in on a few of the Japanese rubber plantations to observe labor conditions. Unfortunately, the inspector could not find any violations, even arbitrary ones. Plantation workers were treated kindly, given frequent breaks, and enjoyed respect from their superiors. With this discovery we possess no other legal ways to shut down and acquire the plantations on these fields. There exist smaller, less habitable fields a few kilometers away which, given the circumstances, will have to do."
 chi.182.a:0 "I guess we're opening up shop nearby?"

 chi.183.t:0 "Black Gold in Shengli"
 chi.183.d:0 "The recently discovered Shengli oil field just west of Japanese Shandong presents itself as a risky, yet tantalizing endeavour. The greatest shortage faced within the sphere is the shortage of oil. Prior to the Pacific War, both China and Japan received hefty oil imports from the United States. Following deteriorating relations with the US in the postwar period, Japan and, at large, China have faced acute oil shortages. If we can access this oil field and exploit it, we would have access to one of the largest oil supplies in the sphere."
 chi.183.a:0 "Excellent!"

 chi.184.t:0 "The Towers in the Distance"
 chi.184.d:0 "Each day, the villagers would wander out early in the morning and watch the massive steel towers in the distance churn out a deep black smoke. Each day in the village, the ground would shake with the intensity of an earthquake. Some of the older men, on the verge of senility, prostrated to the ground, praying for the gods to have mercy.\n\nSurprisingly, it was the children who understood what was happening. The west, the land of oil and blood, was bringing it's innovations to China, and they were coming quickly and unrelentingly. One early saturday morning, the thumping stopped. There was an unusual quiet, and the towers paused for a moment, swaying ever so slightly in the wind. Finally, they began to belch the blackest smoke any of the villagers had ever seen, like a squid's ink. Shengli's oil was striking."
 chi.184.a:0 "Soon, even the peasant will live a comfortable, cosmopolitan life."

 chi.185.t:0 "When it Rains, it Pours."
 chi.185.d:0 "Ramrod, slide. Crack. Repeat. Repeat. Eventually, we will hit the oil we know is beneath us. Ramrod, slide. Crack. Repeat. Repeat. Work harder, I know you're tired. This is the best we've got. Ramrod, slide. Crack. What's this? We've struck oil. Come on, break through. Crack. Spark. The entire well goes up in flames. Try again."
 chi.185.a:0 "Keep going."

 chi.186.t:0 "Shocking!"
 chi.186.d:0 "The coal mined to the north-west was at one point a serious burden to transport. It generated great amounts of electricity but could only service the immediate area so we would have to transport coal to separate facilities. This is no longer the case with the successful opening of our first long distance power line. The line transfers electricity produced in the Nanchang flows on lines to power the factories in Changsha, eliminating the need for coal imports and freeing up precious railroad space."
 chi.186.a:0 "Power to the people!"

 chi.187.t:0 "Powerless"
 chi.187.d:0 "The All Chinese Power Station in Nanchang opened to thunderous applause. At long last China possessed the capability to provide for and sustain a working intermediate-range power grid. But then the kinks started to rear their ugly head. Now, the Nanchang power lines are inconsistent, with brownouts and unpredictable maintenance making it hard to enjoy the luxury of electricity. Factories are able to run and resource extraction goes well but not without moments of frustration. Every week a technician is fried trying to service road-side power lines and there is no solution in sight. It is hard to not feel a bit disappointed, like we could have done a bit better of a job."
 chi.187.a:0 "More power?"

 chi.188.t:0 "The Wants of the People"
 chi.188.d:0 "As we modernize our industry it is easy to forget perhaps the most important resource in industrialization: the common worker. The common worker spends 8 to 12 hours a day working, gets paid, has a home, many a family, and at present has nothing to provide them with anything extra. This uncomfortably sad reality pushes a solution: build urban factories that produce goods exclusively for civilian consumption. Though not explicitly viable for , providing a family with the opportunity to buy toiletries or clothing improves their quality of life and improves the worker's ability to work. Let's get investing!"
 chi.188.a:0 "Pour a few dollars in."

 chi.189.t:0 "How Much Is That Duck In The Window?"
 chi.189.d:0 "So much had been lost in the years between the Japanese invasion to the present day. Not only people, but experiences, opportunities lost forever, robbed by power hungry politicians. No more is that more apparent than in the dilapidated remains of the toy factory in Nanjing. Long ago, the factory would churn out children's playthings, puzzles, dolls, and the flagship product, the wooden duck. The factory was repurposed once the war came. The building that brought fanatasy and fun to life was twisted into something dark, a mutitions plant, a tool for murder.\n\nThe war is long over and it's high time that joy returns to China. The government has financed a refurbishment of the factory. Everything comes back to the modernizations, a modern nation is not a miserable nation."

 chi.190.d:0 "Chaung wiped the sweat off his hands in his pockets. He kept his head low and his pace fast as he navigated the endless, identical, cubicles of corporate. Maybe it was a promotion! The presentation did go really well all things considered, maybe they noticed his potential, would be nice to just be noticed at all. His eyes flickered around the dimly lit room, the buzzing of the fluorescent lights became more and more intense as he ascended up the spiral stairs. Before him, a white door beckoned him down the narrow hallway. Chaung was trapped. Encircled by doors, there was no going back now.\n\nHe gripped the knob, and held it there for a second. Perhaps he could turn around? Make a run for it, jump out a window, do anything rather than face Mr. Masuko. Chaung let go of the doorknob and turned around. Move. Move. One leg in front of the other. He willed his body to move but despite the unyielding desire to escape to freedom, he was frozen in time. If he left, the debt collectors would have his head, and then his family. He remained still for minutes, hours, days, centuries in the infinite Hell of doors and humming lights.\n\nHe sheepishly poked his head into the room, "Y-y-you wanted to see me sir?" Smoke emanated from behind the gargantuan lavender chair. "Took you long enough. Let me make it clear. You're done. Not gonna bullshit you." Chaung's head dropped, banging against the door. "You're not needed here. Find work in Harbin or jump out of the window, I don't care." The chair shook as the man cackled, a cackle which quickly devolved into a wheeze. A sharp inhale with another cloud of smoke following was the last clear image he saw. His eyes began to sting. What was he supposed to do? How could he provide for his family? Chaung tried to thank the businessman for his time but couldn't find the words, bowing out with a feeble "Yes sir.""

 chi.191.t:0 "Seeds of the Complex" 
 chi.191.d:0 "The Chinese military is quite the grotesque beast, as it always has been. During the war, Chinese troops sported whatever they or their superiors could scrounge up. It was not unusual to see a Kuomintang soldier fighting tooth and nail with a German helmet, French boots, a Turkish uniform, and an American rifle. Now, all troops use the equipment of one nation, and one nation only; Japan. However, Japan would much rather keep their own military in shape then fund one that serves little practical purpose but to attack guerillas; our supply is inconsistent at best and non-existent at worst. If our military is to ever strengthen itself, we must take true control of our soldiers and the clothes on their back. The China built by Gao will not fight with Japanese, American, or German equipment. It will fight with China."

As the war closed and the Japanese asserted their control over Zhongguo, the great forges and bangs of the arsenal dimmed. The land of gunpowder's gunpowder had been silenced.\n\nAnd so China traded rice for guns and wheat for uniforms. The troops languished with inaction. And as the Chinese arms industry seemed to take it's final breaths, Hanyang began to churn. Inside it's hallways, workers rushed back and forth, eager to continue work that had been put on hiatus. In an office tucked in the corner of the arsenal, an engineer unveiled a blueprint covered with statistics and clean drawings of a gun. "

 chi.193.d:0 "An uncomfortable crash rings out from within Hanyang Arsenal. The recently imported American tooling machines are quite useful, skillfully tripping our steel to the shame of battle rifle receivers. With great quality comes great price however, and we are unable to purchase more than five of the machines so we have resorted to reverse engineering. It would seem our engineers missed a few steps in reconstructing the machines though as at present our Chinese machines have consistently vibrated themselves to bits. In our attempts at cutting costs we have, in a way, temporarily neutered our arms industry."

 chi.194.t:0 "Arms of the Sphere"
 chi.194.d:0 "China has been named "The Breadbasket of the Sphere" by contemptuous imperialists, insistent on referencing our subservience to the Japanese. While condescending, this remark highlights the fact that Chinese rice and millet feeds the armies of the Sphere, a stance that offers our nation a sort of shadowy control over the Sphere. Our chief economic advisor has recommended that perhaps China could also feed the Sphere's armies rifles as well as dinner through industrial expansion. There is much to be done, but imagine a future where every soldier holds Chinese breakfast in one hand and a rifle in the other!"

Strikers cry for "greater pay" and "reduced quotas" while marching through the streets. They look pathetic from here, malnourished bodies hobbling around outside the factory gates. It seemed only right to put them down when the city garrison arrived and broke the strike. Production rates are increasing, but we will need to source some new laborers."

"Chinese Domestic Plant #1", a hastily converted primary school campus, has finally bore fruit in the form of heavy tracked machinery and load-bearing transports. The factory itself is run with an entirely Japanese management staff and employs a Japanese "security force" to ensure production quotas are met. The working environment is cut throat, harshly critical, and unforgiving of error, meaning production is quick and of good quality. Though the job is taxing on workers, many peasants are glad to have a stable income. With the success of this plant we now possess the capability to sew the seeds of Chinese industry!"

"Chinese Domestic Plant #1", a hastily converted primary school campus, has bore no fruit for us. At first we were optimistic, almost convinced of the bright future promised to us by those Japanese snake oil salesmen. Then we saw the first tractor. It drove perfectly well for about 30 meters before erratically spewing black smoke and altogether lodging itself in a ditch. Subsequent tests were no more successful and it became apparent very quickly that we had made a mistake. Regardless, the all-Japanese management offered a toast of sake and declared the factory open for business. It would seem that the zaibatsu sees the favorable resource rights as a greater priority than our strangle-hold contract and has diverted only low quality materials and expertise to the plant for production. Cancelling our contract would likely anger the Japanese, so it seems we will have to bear the brunt of immobile tractors for years to come."

 chi.207.t:0 "City Bound!"
 chi.207.d:0 "As we expected, introducing mechanization to the fields reduced the number of farm hands and has freed up a manpower to immigrate to the city. Our government is more than happy to welcome this population to our urban areas and have sponsored the construction of worker's barracks across the country. These workers, with their skills in management and production from their farm work, will no doubt be great additions to our factory staffs. An added bonus of this is that with mechanized farming introduced, our crop yield is increasing despite the actual number of farm hands decreasing. Not all areas are as successful (some reporting "serious regional famines" due to "a lack of qualified personnel") but this is no doubt a victory on our road to self sufficiency."

 chi.208.t:0 "Great Tumble Backwards"
 chi.208.d:0 "Reports have come in regarding our recent efforts to mechanize the rural fields and it would appear we have fallen short of our goals. The tractors we sold to farmers at discounted rates are not performing to the standard that we promised, usually due to operator error. Many farmers have no knowledge of mechanical workings and a few believe that water is a viable substitute for gasoline. Along with the tractors, we also sold the idea that farmers could downsize on hands and still increase profits, which lead to many farm owners preemptively firing hands. When reports reached us of the onset of regional crop failure, we had no choice but to turn back the recent urban immigrants to avoid a widespread famine. With workers returning to their plow, famine seems unlikely but we remain without skilled workmen in our urban factories - at least for now."

Elders deemed "too old to work" are paid by the state to hang posters around town to encourage the hard working principles now valued by Chinese society. We have engineered a culture that can sustain our industrial momentum for generations to come."

 chi.210.t:0 "Let Them Eat Cake"
 chi.210.d:0 "Only China could be so strong as to reform her identity, despite the growing pains. In schools, the children receive a thorough engineering education, despite their interests, and form Youth Labor Squads for voluntary factory work. Children are expected to work twice a week for variable hours. This labor is unpaid and, despite our claims that such work will "envigor personality and working spirit", many students complain about cruel conditions. Some soldiers given "factory duty" are said to steal from production lines and sell arms on the black market. We wish to control the working culture of our nation but it does not come easy. Sometimes force is necessary."

Now, an entire fleet of ships sail up and down the trail delivering goods and passengers to urban industrial centers. The rifle receivers stamped in Wuhan are fitted with wooden stocks in Nanjing and are shipped now to foreign purchasers through Shanghai. Aluminium aircraft frames riveted in Changsha sail to be fitted with engines produced in Nanchang, then take off from Nanjing! The hustle and bustle of the modern era is upon China and her good servants have made it so!"

The schedules for transportation have been packed so tight that when one ship is late, all ships are late. What good are the wooden rifle stocks in Nanjing if they cannot be fitted with the receivers produced in Wuhan? How will Nanchang's aircraft engines take flight if the aluminium airframes from Changsha are 3 days late? China is stronger, yes, but maybe she will benefit from spreading out delivery times."

 chi.214.t:0 "Arrival"
 chi.214.d:0 "Li gazed through the narrow streets before him, struggling to recall the city which he had called his childhood home. Cobbled streets and wooden walls danced behind his eyes. But it all slipped through his mind like a sieve, hazy like so many other memories of his forgotten childhood. But now he was back, back in Beijing: worlds apart from the sleepy rural village his mother had fled with him to. Ancient wooden structures and stones carved by years of use still surrounded Li, but here and there he could spot a tower of glass and steel, the first children of a new China and the gateway to a new life for Li and his family.\n\nLi marched on, grasping onto his youngest sons hand so that the flowing mass of people would not sweep him away. The family stayed close together: Li's wife, his three children and ancient grandfather all struck by the size and the pace of the city, beset by a thousand vendors and shoved by a thousand more migrants just like themselves. It was the first time any of them could remember any city larger than a market town: their new home overawed them.\n\nBut it was all so much opportunity to Li: his sons would not suffer the same humiliation as him, and his family would not be tied down in the rural backwater which the government was already leaving behind. No, here in Beijing Li would set a new path, here he would not break his back over a plow. Here he would rise, here his sons would become the new men of the new China. The only question was where to start.\n\nThe Li family had not come to this new world empty handed: the children carried pans and spoons, Li's wife carried food, Li himself had a great metal plate and whatever else he could fit on his back. Where there are people there is hunger, and where there is hunger there is money. They marched on blending into the press of the booming city, where rich and poor pushed through on cars, trawleys, donkeys and on foot. Li took one moment to look back at his entourage and call out:"
 chi.214.a:0 "Welcome to Beijing; our new home!"

 chi.215.t:0 "Setting Up Shop"
 chi.215.d:0 ""Grandfather, stay with Yong. Neither of you can continue on like this."\n\n"I said I would help you in this city, Li. Are you telling me to lie to you, to go back on my word? No."\n\nIn the dim electric light of their ramshackle home Li gazed at the sleeping bodies of his family, tangled up in eachothers arms on the ground. Beijing had not been kind to them, and trying to adjust to life as a street vendor had taken its toll on body and soul. Li was no stranger to hard work, nor was his family: forcing a living out of the Chinese land had given all but the youngest hands of iron. But even so Beijing had punished them for their naivete, and none more so than Li's ancient godfather.\n\nThe old man's legs were twitching, he had started to cough, and there were sours on his arms which refused to heal. His body which had survived who knew how many years was breaking down, even if his stubbornness was alive and well.\n\n"You must stay here father, I did not come here to kill you. What about your granddaughter, the kids. You think they want to see you-"\n"What about them! I was here when the emperor died, you think I'm going to fall to this! Stop this insolence, I'm still able to walk. You just make sure that you do your part as well."\n\nAnd so another day came and went, the red sun slowly setting over Beijing. Li could not help but wonder if he had made a terrible mistake. He had sold everything to get here, what little of worth he had was now far away or melted down, all so that he may have this chance. Grandfather slowly turned away and into the rooms one small chair, freeing Li's gaze to fall once more on his wife and children huddling together. Exhausted and forlorn Li nonetheless felt a smile tug at his face. Three sons and a wife. Mother had been so happy when she heard the news. Wrapping his arms around them Li finally succumbed to sleep, another long and tiring day gone by."
 chi.215.a:0 "Do it for them."

 chi.216.t:0 "Success and Progress"
 chi.216.d:0 ""You look like you could use a pork bun!" "A man who has not eaten Jianbing is never a full man!" "Why don't you have a dumpling in your hand?"\n\nLi smiled through the sweat on his face: he had found it, a place for his business. The city was growing both upwards and outwards. His eldest son Wei remarked that it was just like him: every day it seems another inch, another pound was added. Wei was already fourteen, older by far than the nine year old Jie or the three year old Yong, and he had taken to Beijing well. Almost to well: he had begun to talk like a native, his gait had become attuned to the booming city picking up its pace, and he had even gained friends in the sons of the workers and engineers Li sold to.\n\nAnd what better place for his own business to grow than at the bleeding edge of Beijing, where hundreds of laborers are bussed in to construct factories, housing blocks, new streets and malls. Li had not been the only street vendor to tag alongside the new wave of industrialization, but perhaps he had found the perfect spot: right off the crossroads and just close enough to the hundreds of hungry laborers sent to build a new China, living on the site they worked. A captive audience if there ever was one.\n\nLife was still hard, very hard. Li despite himself would dream of the open and green fields, the crisp still air of a world waking up. The city he had learned never sleeps, and it felt that neither did he. Before the sun rose Li would leave his cramped and leaking room, stepping over the still sleeping bodies of the children. For hours he would run across the city or stand over the boiling oil of his craft and he would not return to his rented housing until the sun had set and the night was lit up by the lights of a million souls. It occurred to him that he had never seen the stars in the Beijing night sky.\n\nBut still, it was life. A routine to stand by, a craft to master, and a near perfect spot of the city in which to practice it. His wife even whispered in Li's ear that she may be pregnant, another son no doubt. Yes sir, at long last Li could stand on his own feet."
 chi.216.a:0 "Maybe I should buy a Hachimaki, no one wants sweat in their food."

 chi.217.t:0 "Competition and Degradation"
 chi.217.d:0 "Li had seen bayonets duller than the eyes of the three who arrived today. Scarcely two meters from the spot Li's stall had been for the past two months a new group set up shop. Young, sharp, and most of all dangerous in Li's eyes.\n\nIt was early morning, and the cool mist still rolled through the streets, not yet dispelled by the light traffic. Li set his face to stone and allowed himself to hope that they were merely mistaken, that his apprehension was merely from his fatigue. He approached the trio as they were finishing unfolding their stand.\n\n"What do you want?" snapped the tallest of the two men before Li had a chance to speak\n\nLi stuttered out "I have been in this spot for over a month. It's my spot, everyone knows this."\n\nThe shorter of the two snorted. "What does the peasant want Xi?"\n\n"He says we're in his spot, wants us to leave."\n\nWalking up the Li the third member of the trio, a woman, said straight to his face "Well I didn't see you here this morning. Find your own spot."\n\nLi was shocked. He had expected them to be rude as so many city people were, but this? Li purposefully looked away from the woman and back toward Xi.\n\n"This is my spot. Ask anyone, even the construction workers. What is wrong with you?"\n\n"Then you should have gotten here a bit faster. You peasant migrants always move so slow, but that's your loss." With that the group turned away and continued to set up their stand.\n\nLi had no words. His ancient grandfather came to bring him back to reality.\n\n"Its not worth it Li, for now let's find another spot." Li nodded silently and moved on. But in his heart he knew this was not over: he was not done. For over a month he had carved out a spot in this city for himself and for his family in that spot. He would not let it go so easily."
 chi.217.a:0 "They want to see you do good, but never better than them."

 chi.218.t:0 "The Fight (Part 1)"
 chi.218.d:0 "For weeks the trio and Li had been in an undeclared war, and Li could not help but feel that he was on the losing end. First his son betrayed him. Wei had claimed that he was going to run over the the market to buy lettuce, and asked for money to buy it with just like any other day. And Li waited for him, for hours through the hot mid day. He sent out his wife to see what had become of him, but she returned empty handed. Li had no other choice but to close his stand early and send the entire family out to find the boy, the fear of finding nothing but a body growing every minute. And where had he been found? Behind some wall smoking with his "friends", the money nowhere to be seen. And then just two days ago Grandfather had finally admitted that he needed rest, that his wizened legs were pushed too far. To all this Li had set his face to stone, and prepared to shoulder yet more weight. But today... today was different.\n\nLi's wife came to him, her eyes full of tears as he had rarely ever seen before. Try as she may to wipe them away still they came.\n\n"What happened? Why are you crying?" Li hurried to her side looking her over for injuries, finding none. Between small gasps the story came forth.\n\n"I just... I just wanted to talk with the lady... I told her I was pregnant and she, she-"\n\n"What did she do?" Li's anger flowed as it never had before, and he had no doubt which woman it was that had done this.\n\n"She called me an ugly peasant whore... and said China did not need any more children from me."\n\nWithout another word Li left his stand and marched over to the trio, once again standing on his claim. He grabbed the woman and began to yell, the weeks of frustration pouring out of him given new sharpness by this attack on his very honor.\n\nIt was not long before another member came to see the comotion. "You get away from her!" Xi came at him, tearing the woman away and striking Li across the face. There was no going back now, they both went at each other with violence. Rolling around in the dust, bowling over pedestrians and frightening horses. Li torn out a chunk of Xi's hair, Xi kicked him in the groin."
 chi.218.a:0 "Ouch."

 chi.219.t:0 "The Fight (Part 2)"
 chi.219.d:0 "Xi was taller than him, so Li kept to the ground, rolling the two of them through the filth of the street. At length Li started to gain the advantage while a human ring formed around the two, the quarrel quickly turning into a spectator sport. With a grunt of strength learned on the fields of china Li managed to buck Xi off of him and pin the man to the ground, pummeling his head. Gasping for breath Li tightened his grip as Xi weakly squirmed beneath him, when from behind he heard a cry. "You bastard!" Li turned around just in time for the short one to bash his face in with a metal plate.\n\nA woman screamed. Li fell to the ground, stuned. He felt the blood gush from his mouth, and saw shattered teeth beneath him. Another heavy blow to the spine sent Li to his stomach, writhing in pain. But there in front of him he saw his wife, her hands covering her mouth and her eyes wide in fear. No, he would not fall to this. He rolled away and struggled to his feet in time to hear another sound: the sharp whistle of the Beijing police and the shouts of men forcing their way through the ring. Li however only had eyes for the man in front of him, forcing his body to keep moving through the pain. The short man swung once, twice, and caught Li's fist in his gut before the police made it to them. With a swift and precise crack Li found himself back on the ground as the police beat him with nightsticks. As he and the other two were dragged away he could see through swollen eyes his nine year old son being held back by Wei, screaming for the police to give his father back."
 chi.219.a:0 "My sons, what will become of my sons?"

 chi.220.t:0 "Jail"
 chi.220.d:0 "Li had lost track of time long ago, or at least what felt long ago. No sun or moon would reach into his cell, only the light of a flickering bulb hanging from a dusty string and no clock to measure the time. No comfort for the damned was to be found in the prison. Twice a day he was lead to a mess hall to eat food he could not chew, and every once in a while someone else would be thrown into the cell before being moved out. Li did not know where they went, nor did he ask. How long has it been since I last spoke?\n\nThere was little for Li to do other than nurse his wounded body and worry. Always worry, like a tiger pacing round and round in its cage until it drops from exhaustion, unable to eat even if food were given to it. What of Yong, what of grandfather? What would become of his stand? His wife had only just seemed settled, and the child inside her... no. Could Wei survive? Would he abandon his family again in their time of need?\n\nThe light bulb flickered and died, plunging Li into a deeper darkness than even the rural night. Some guard swore loudly from down the hall: the power had gone out. Curling up on the bench Li once again cradled his swollen jaw and despite himself tongued at his newly missing teeth. No one was coming, and time stretched on."
 chi.220.a:0 "Minutes into hours, hours into days."

 chi.221.t:0 "Return to the Light"
 chi.221.d:0 "Li woke up to the clang of a baton on the bars of his cage. "You: time to go" snapped the guard. Li nodded and shuffled through his cell door. The guard escorted him through the jail up to the front gate, where he gave a nod to the gatekeeper and unshackled Li's wristes. "Right then, off you go." Li blinked through the sun, squinting at the guard. "What?" The guard frowned. "You heard me: you're free to go". And with that Li was pushed out the gate, which closed behind him. He was free.\n\nIn a daze Li wandered the sweltering streets, lost in a section of Beijing he had never seen before. At length he caught on, finding first a landmark, then a street which he knew. As the sun began to set he made it, and stood face to face with his stall.\n\n"Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand!" "You look like a man who could use some Jianbing!"\n\nThere in front of him, with a Hachimaki rope bound around his head, was his son Wei. He was working the stall alone like a madman: baking, packaging and selling all at once. He had rings around his eyes and sores on his wrists, his clothing was filthy. But there he was, and there was the food stand, all safe. The trio was nowhere to be seen. Li felt tears welling up in his eyes as he beheld his eldest son.\n\nAs Li walked up to the stand Wei finally caught sight of him. Wei stopped what he was doing as if struck, leaving the egg to burn on the plate. The sight of his father: thin, bruised and weakend was a shock. What happened next was hardly less shocking: Li bowed.\n\n"Thank you, Wei, for doing what I could not."\n\nWei shook his head. "Stand up dad, it was the construction workers, not me. I only did what I had to."\n\nWei told Li of what had happened while he was in jail. How he had told his friends, who had told their fathers of what the trio had done to Li and his mother. Of how they and the other workers started to boycott the trio's stand no matter how low they set the prices. How grandfather had forced himself to work through his illness until he could no longer stand, and how his mother had grown heavier and heavier until she too took ill. How he had been left all alone when the trio packed up and left. All this and more came spilling out of the 14 year olds mouth as he clung to his father. The nightmare was over, and day had come.\n\nAs the two embraced Li felt the worries of the past month fall from his back. The world had aligned against him, and he had come out the other end. It would not be easy, but he and his family survived, and surely the worst had past. For now, for the first time in months, Li did not think about the future. He was simply happy to be free."

Though it is largely based on factual events the book is first and foremost an adventure novel, told through the guise of a diary of the unnamed main character. Each snippet of this adventure that is written begs more questions than it answers, driving the reader onwards evermore in search of answers and longing to get a full view of this hero's deeds.

 chi.310.d:0 "Nanjing has become a bubbling cauldron of excitement as Government Officials and Film Stars flock to the capital. On the schedule was the premier of the film "The Life of Wang Anshi" at The Capital Theater, with all the pomp of an American Hollywood event. The film, which went from script to screen in under a year, deals with the life and reforms of Wang Anshi; a major figure of reform during the Song Dynasty. It stars iconic actor Jin Yan as the former Minister in his last days, reflecting on his life and how his reforms were all brought down by those who sought to fuel their own power.\n\nThough the work is incredibly moving, it uses a wide brush to paint a new political reality for the public: China is beginning her first steps towards reform. The message, carefully crafted by The Ministry of Culture, seeks to depict those who seek to stifle progress and reform as the basest form of creature while lionizing figures like Anzhi. In particular the film went to great lengths to show Empress Gao as close to a demon as possible, using a great deal of makeup to craft a distorted visage that embodies corruption.\n\nThe film closes with a slow pan along the Yangtze as Yan reads a piece of Anshi's poetry "Green in the spring winds, the south bank of the Yangtse. When will the bright moon light my journey home? " with Shanghai just visible in the distance as the sun begins to rise."

 chi.311.d:0 "Shi Meng ate his rice in silence. Rain was coming. The clouds danced swiftly across the sky. Putting down his bowl, he got back to work. His break was over. Picking up his tools and pulling up the bottom of his pants, he trudged back onto the field. Tilling the fields of cabbage for what seemed like the fiftieth time this day, his mind couldn't help but wander to whatever 12-year-olds think about.\n\nShi rarely left the farm, unless he was grabbing groceries in town. He was born, raised, and lived in the fields. It might be boring, but his family had done it for generations. There was no sign that it would ever change. The fields were Shi's home, and like any home, they offered security, albeit a dull one. The closest connections to the outside world were when tax-collectors and census-takers trudged out here, in the middle of nowhere, to collect any meager money and count the meager people. There were murmurs of modernization, but these were nothing but vague rumors to Shi's parents and meant nothing to himself. The most "modernization" they had seen was the tractor a neighboring family owned.\n\nThe boy was walking back to his hut when his parents yelled for him to come quick. Running with a rake in his right hand and his box for lunch in his left, he pushed open the door to see his parents sitting with an unfamiliar man. Shi was instantly concerned. Had a relative passed away? Were the Japanese finally here to snatch away his parents?\n\nThe man turned toward Shi and smiled. He began speaking in a Shanghai accent, cosmopolitan and formal, the model urban lingo."
 chi.311.a:0 ""Hello, Shi. Your parents and I were just talking about the new school opening in town.""

 chi.312.t:0 "The Old Gymnasium"
 chi.312.d:0 "Shi woke to a dawning morning. Today was the first day of school, and like any other boy and girl in China, he was nervous. The regular anxiety of a simple boy was only magnified by the sudden need for education. He would much prefer to just stay with his family. However, Shi dreamed of a larger world. Sometimes, he daydreamed of seeing the world beyond his town. Shi jumped onto his rattled bike, his Flying Pigeon. In the crisp morning air, the mountains of the Gobi desert, with all their unwelcoming beauty, were barely visible to him. The sun peeked over the mountaintops, making the path just a bit brighter. Flanked on both sides by the towering Taihang peaks, Shi's bike bumped along on the way to town. Rounding a corner, the lights of his farm disappeared behind him. Somewhere ahead of him was a school. He had a long way to go.\n\nThe trip was long; the nearest school was 4 dozen kilometers away. Luckily, Shi's parents were not ones to give in and skip out on the new education reforms. Shi Meng, whether he liked it or not, would be the first to read in his family since time immemorial."
 chi.312.a:0 "Hit the books, Shi!"

 chi.313.t:0 "The Older Town"
 chi.313.d:0 "The village rose into view, and Shi let out a sigh. He was finally here. The town was just waking up. Somewhere, a rooster crowed. A man walked along the dirt street, ringing a bell and waking up any stragglers. Stopping his Flying Pigeon, Shi asked a sleepy village person where the school was. The man pointed down the street, to the old recreational hall.\n\nThe dingy gymnasium had gone unused for many years. The imprints of the twelve-pointed sun, long gone, still left their mark on the wall. Old efforts led by the republican government to lead the peasants of China forward had resoundingly failed. The recreation room sat as a vestige of an earlier era, one without the looming Japanese overlord, one of war and hope. The gym was a blemish upon the village, a simple ruin. This time, China would not recede back to the forgotten hope left after the war.\n\nShi was early. He didn't know how to read a clock, but the lack of both teacher and student was a giveaway. As the sun finally finished its daily transit over the horizon, the town quickly became alive. In no time, students both eager and miserable funneled into the makeshift school, and teachers rolled in school supplies and carts full of textbooks."
 chi.313.a:0 "Is this... school?"

 chi.314.t:0 "The Teacher"
 chi.314.d:0 "The teacher was originally from outside of Nanjing, born during the war. Her mother was killed during the Nanjing Incident, and while she didn't remember her, she certainly noticed the lack of a mother in her life. Both she and her lonely father fervently hated the Japanese. By the time she had pursued a career in teaching, Chinese calls for teachers out west had already been put out. She reported eagerly. The frontier seemed to call to her, in all its romantic glory.\n\nAn old automobile drove her into the village, the sort that dotted China, a fish in the biggest sea in the world. Driving through, she methodically noted the different homes. The mayor's office, a little edifice with a five races flag, lay in the center. Down the road from the office lay an old gymnasium, where the new school would be. A few shops lay along the road, doubling as homes for the shopkeepers. There was little else, though roads led to cabbage farms outside of town. It all was so urgent. Today she would get settled in her new house, a little apartment complex set up for teachers. It must have been the first building built in the last 50 years."

Dragging her chalk on the chalkboard and squeaking out her name, Li Zhou, she sighed at the task ahead of her. Reciting her name and making sure each student knew, she began the task she was here to do; teach.\n\nBy the middle of the day Li had already spotted her favorite students; there were those who had an innate love of learning, and there were those who lacked that love. Li made sure to remind herself that these were to be the future of China and all deserved to be taught the same. More importantly, they were to be the ones that would hopefully put an end to the Japanese stranglehold. It is improper (and certainly illegal) for her to share her true beliefs with the students but deep down she hoped that her teaching would prepare the generation that would unhinge the Yamato grip."

 chi.316.t:0 "The Words"
 chi.316.d:0 "Shi rode his Flying Pigeon back to school. It had become part of his daily routine, and he relished the solitude and exercise it brought. He would hum tunes on his way. The daily biking had made him fit, more fit then his arduous work on the fields. He had found friends at schools, people who thought and talked like him. He fit in at school. More importantly, he was learning. Shi caught on quickly to reading and excelled far more than other students. His teacher was determined to teach, and she taught well.\n\nLi had settled into her job well. The students were moving along better than expected, and she loved the environment, harsh as it may be. The land might not be full of the rugged romanticism she loved, but it paid the bills. Unexpectedly, most of the youth were eager to learn the language, arithmetic, and history. Attendance was solid, and her colleagues worked almost as hard as her. Maybe, she thought to herself, maybe China stood a chance.\n\nIn time, the students would learn to read and the teachers would grow gray. Across China, the illiterate turned into the literate. Education was the talk of policy-makers in the capital. The Japanese secretly admired the grand modernization of the schools of China."

Less than 0.5 percent of our population possess the skills we need to begin modernizing. Large portions of our population are not only technically illiterate, but completely illiterate. If we are to become a powerhouse of innovation, we must educate a generation of experts in fields ranging from modern irrigation practices to electrical grid management. As frustrating as it is to admit, we must acknowledge that Japan produces some of the finest technology in the world and, by extension, some of the finest technicians. Several prominent Japanese technicians have expressed interest in the Five Modernizations program. We should invite them to advise our technological development and teach at our technical schools.

Today is his first day as the repairman at an apartment complex that recently installed electric lighting and heating. With the help of Japanese instructors and a not insignificant amount of learning by trial and error, the first class of chinese technicians is starting to show real promise. Already we are relying less on the Japanese to install and repair new devices for us. Instruction manuals printed in Mandarin are beginning to replace those printed in Japanese. Our foreign guides seem surprised, and even a little dismayed, at how quickly their students are progressing. Steps are being taken to further integrate these newly minted technological specialists into our modernization program, as well as into the burgeoning chinese electronic manufacturing sector. Long considered an impossible dream, the idea of a modern, self sufficient china seems more attainable with each passing day."

 chi.319.t:0 "A Good Problem to Have"
 chi.319.d:0 "While our training schools have helped create the first generation of Chinese technicians, it is not enough. As China's industry continues to modernize and expand, the demand for skilled laborers will increase until the government will be unable to afford to educate all of the workers our economy requires. This has become a problem much sooner than we anticipated, as already more of our citizens are applying to the training programs than we can make room to teach. To avoid creating an educational bottleneck, it has been proposed that instead of training all of the workers ourselves, we subsidize the creation of technical education programs at Chinese universities and businesses, as well as fund the research and development of new technologies by these students. In return for this aid, our government would receive significant discounts on any potential products our students may create, as well as access to all research that is produced by them. Regardless of what these bright minds end up creating, we will learn much valuable information and help create the skilled labor force we have lacked for so long."
 chi.319.a:0 "The Chinese government has always supported entrepreneurship!"

 chi.320.t:0 "A Grand Opening"
 chi.320.d:0 "Yesterday a new store opened in Wuchang. The freshly painted sign above the door read "Li's Electronic Goods and Repair." Inside the shelves are filled with new radios, hot plates, record players, cameras, and even a few TVs. Li's business is off to a good start, but it will not be long until he faces competition, as stores like his are popping up all across the country. As more and more technology is manufactured in China, more and more businesses are emerging to sell these new marvels to the eager Chinese people. However, these new stores are not local branches of some far off corporation based in Tokyo or Hiroshima. They are, by and large, wholly owned and operated by Chinese citizens cashing in on this growing market. Reports have reached us that some of the particularly successful companies have even begun hiring Chinese technicians to design new, competing products to reduce reliance on Japanese suppliers. At long last, our investments have paid off, and Chinese technology is turning a profit"
 chi.320.a:0 "A modern economy is within our grasp!"

 chi.321.t:0 "Project 680 Takes Off"
 chi.321.d:0 "As the gap between China and the modern world continues to shrink, our research efforts have begun to shift from studying the technology of other countries to developing our own new innovations. Morale among our scientists and engineers has increased as they are no longer limited to reverse engineering Japanese products and infrastructure, and are free to pursue their long held hypotheses at last. Numerous research efforts on everything from handheld radios to modernized radar stations are already underway. One particular project has grabbed the public's attention, and is receiving significant media coverage as it progresses. Formally referred to as Project 680, the Dì Yī Jī medium-range ballistic missile will be the first ever Chinese designed missile system, and if testing is successful, it is expected to become a mainstay of our new military arsenal. While we have not yet received approval from the Japanese, likely because the Dì Yī Jī would be fully capable of reaching the most populous areas of the Japanese home islands, the project is proceeding at an excellent pace, with several prototypes under construction and early testing scheduled before the end of the year."

 chi.322.t:0 "Plans for the Future"
 chi.322.d:0 "While we have made great strides in our journey to make China technologically self sufficient, it is not enough that we have the personnel with the knowledge and experience to pull China into the modern age. We must also have the plans to build the technology we need. From cars to radios to to hydroelectric dams, there are countless designs we must have if we ever want to escape from the dark ages. The Japanese technicians we have hired have brought some of these blueprints with them, but the other designs will have to be acquired from Japanese companies. Our contacts in Japan have managed to exploit the economic crisis, playing the various corporations and conglomerates off of each other. By pledging support to both the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus in return for various important designs, we have been able to procure all of the plans we need. Of course, when the time comes to return the favor, our agents will be long gone, and the Japanese will have bigger problems to deal with than some Chinese industrial espionage."
 chi.322.a:0 "We're playing both sides. That way we always come out on top!"

 chi.323.t:0 "Catching the Wave of the Future"
 chi.323.d:0 "While their current use is somewhat limited, especially in China where electricity is a rare luxury, there is no denying that computers will be instrumental in technological and societal development in the coming decades. Our clerks and accountants spend weeks combing through disorganized and often incomplete records and running numbers to provide reports and answers a computer could generate in a few hours. To avoid falling even further behind the modern world than we already have we must begin implementing computing technology into the Five Modernization plans immediately. Luckily there are several Japanese companies who have offered to sell their computer design plans to us in return for a commitment to use the newly built machines to improve agricultural production and manufacturing output. Of course, once we have the designs there is nothing to stop us from using them for other purposes..."
 chi.323.a:0 "We humbly accept this most gracious offer"

 chi.324.t:0 "Killing Two Birds with One Stone"
 chi.324.d:0 "While the introduction of computer technology in China has greatly accelerated our path to modernization, it has also exposed some oversights in the plan. Computers are difficult to build and maintain, and this problem is only worsened by the lack of modern construction equipment available in China. By acquiring all the machinery and tools used in modern construction sites, we will be able to build dedicated facilities for our new computers, fully capable of housing and running them. As an added bonus, this new equipment can then be put to use building countless new industrial sites, factories, mines, roads, and other projects that will be vital to the progress of the Chinese nation. Contracts have already been drawn up with multiple suppliers in Japan to sell the equipment at a reduced cost in return for exclusive production rights at the newly built facilities. While this may limit our profits in the short term, it will be worth it to receive state-of-the-art construction machines at such a low cost."
 chi.324.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

 chi.325.t:0 "The Great Reversal Begins"
 chi.325.d:0 "With our purchase of modern construction equipment, China's industry has found itself in an interesting position. While we have all of the required tools and materials to begin manufacturing advanced products on a large scale, the only plans we have are those we have "acquired" from the Japanese, and our technicians are only trained to operate Japanese machines and produce Japanese goods. While we may be able to manufacture Japanese products just as well as they can themselves, we will not be fully technologically independent until we can make our own Chinese tech that surpasses theirs. We have taken steps to ensure this will come to be. In secret laboratories around China our best designers have reverse-engineered Japanese technology, discovering what works, what doesn't, and how it can be improved. Already the first plans are being drafted, and the factories are being prepared. Soon, it shall be Chinese technology flooding Japanese markets, not the other way around."
 chi.325.a:0 "We are no longer their student, and we will become their master."

 chi.326.t:0 "Cracking the Code"
 chi.326.d:0 "While a few Chinese designed computers have been released, They have not been highly successful. Most have been incredibly slow, several have created a number of safety hazards for their operators, and all of them are barely functional. Everyone from the President of the Republican Government down to the first year students at our technical universities knows that the only acceptable computer is a Japanese computer. A group of computer technicians have recently approached our patent office with a design that may change this. Early tests of the machine, dubbed the JJ Mk. II, shows that it is not only much less likely to catch fire than the JJ Mk. I, but that it is much faster and more power efficient that its predecessors, potentially even on par with Japanese designs. If we fund the designers of the JJ Mk. II and other inventors that develop similarly advanced computers, we could jumpstart the Chinese computer industry and begin the process of overtaking the Japanese in the area they felt their superiority was most secure."
 chi.326.a:0 "The crooks won't be expecting this slap in the face!"

 chi.327.t:0 "A Farmer's Life is a Simple Life"
 chi.327.d:0 "Our new computers have helped us identify multiple problems within our agricultural production. While there are countless small issues hampering our farmers, they are all connected by one common cause: Despite the fact that it makes up the largest sector of our economy, Chinese agriculture has not significantly progressed in centuries. While farmers in other nations use tractors, chemical fertilizer, and water pipelines our farmers still rely on horse drawn plows, manure, and primitive irrigation systems. If China is to retain its position as the Sphere's primary food supplier it is of the utmost importance that we begin to industrialize our agriculture immediately. The cost of purchasing modern agricultural equipment from Japan and reselling it to farmers at affordable rates will be steep, but our financial experts are confident that the increase in crop and livestock yields will more than make up for it within the next ten years."
 chi.327.a:0 "First we sow the seeds..."

 chi.328.t:0 "A Rough Adjustment"
 chi.328.d:0 "When the first shipment of new farming equipment from Japan was quickly bought out by farmers and ranchers across our nation, we had reason to believe that the modernization of our agricultural sector would be an easy process and could mostly be left to the farmers to handle themselves. When a study conducted by our department of agriculture reached the desk of the general secretary of industry and agriculture, these hopes quickly vanished. In Henan, pipes designed to water crops are being used as fence posts and improvised weather vanes. In Fujian, farmers have traded their tractors to cattle ranchers that use the machines to herd their stock. One particularly inventive individual has been burning bags of fertilizer to heat his stables and, if there is any left over, his bathwater. Such waste and misuse of expensive machines must be brought to an end as soon as possible. Orders have been issued to begin a reeducation campaign across rural china to help our agricultural workers properly implement their new equipment into their daily work. We have also made sure that all future products will be sold with detailed instruction manuals included."
 chi.328.a:0 "No transition is ever perfectly smooth."

 chi.329.t:0 "The "Unification" of China"
 chi.329.d:0 "China is a big country. This is no secret to anyone who owns a map, and several people in the Office of Transportation and Logistics do. While the great distances between our urban centers have always been an obstacle to those ruling China, the recent advances our nation has made may finally present a solution. Radio towers have grown from our land like the spines of some agitated beast. Telephone wires criss-cross our country, forming a massive web of communication. Highways and rail lines span the gaps between our cities, bridges across the vast rural sea that separates them. Little by little, day by day, China is becoming more connected. As this connection increases, so does our reaction speed. Regional food shortages rarely develop into famines, and undersupplied businesses now receive their new stock in a timely fashion. It may not be as flashy as a new computer or a shipment of bulldozers, but the advancement of distribution technology has been vital to our path to the future."
 chi.329.a:0 "We may not be at the finish line, but it is now within sight."

 chi.330.t:0 "Nanjing Calling"
 chi.330.d:0 "All across China, from Beijing to Hunan, night after night people are tuning in to their radios to hear the news of China and the world. Our people have the choice of listening to their local stations, or the nationwide broadcasts of the large news agencies in Nanjing, or even a select few privately owned stations, mostly owned by Japanese companies.. Though the majority of our people remain illiterate, radio news stations have made it possible for them to be just as informed on current affairs as any educated newspaper reader. Radio broadcasts have also made coordinating our efforts and inspiring civilian support for the Five Modernizations much easier, as the reach of public announcements is no longer limited to city centers and government offices. Potentially even more exciting than the rise of radio, a team of computer engineers in Jinan successfully transmitted a short message wirelessly over a computer network to a second computer almost 200 kilometers away in Jinan. While this technology is still in its earliest stages, it promises to change how we communicate forever."
 chi.330.a:0 "Rapid communication will be key to defeating the Japanese."

 chi.331.t:0 "AFRGC Report 8599037 is Reviewed"
 chi.331.d:0 "Yesterday a report landed on the desk of the deputy chief of the Chinese National Army, describing a new invention that could be of use to the military. An army engineer in the 8th division, after tinkering with an old American portable radio, has restored it to working order and even manufactured several others based off of this design. While portable radios have existed in the army for some time, they have universally been extremely cumbersome, difficult to use, and unreliable even in ideal conditions. This new "Walkie-Talkie" as it is being called, is barely larger than a telephone handset, wireless, and works well over long distances and in inclement weather. Our generals are practically salivating at the thought of mass producing these radios and distributing them amongst the rank-and-file, and multiple companies are already vying for the production contract. The Walkie Talkie is the pinnacle of our experimentation in radio technology, representing a level of mastery even the Japanese have yet to achieve."
 chi.331.a:0 "We will achieve a whole new level of military coordination."

 chi.332.t:0 "The First Conference of the C.A.W.A. comes to an end"
 chi.332.d:0 ""China may be moving towards industrialization, but we will always be an agricultural nation at heart. As our factories modernize, so too will our farms, ranches, and orchards!"\n\nThese words from the president of the Chinese Agricultural Workers Alliance were met with thunderous applause today. As their first annual conference comes to an end, farmers from all across China return to their everyday lives. The shared feeling among them is one of hope and ambition. In only a few years, they have seen record breaking crop yields and a dramatic increase in quality, all thanks to the influx of new farming equipment and methods that most of them had once considered beyond unattainable. As food prices fall, more and more shipments are being sent to Japan and the rest of the sphere, increasing their reliance on us even more. The period of confusion has come to an end, and China's push towards agricultural modernity has finally, truly begun."
 chi.332.a:0 "...Then we reap the reward!"

 chi.333.t:0 "Sold Out of Everything"
 chi.333.d:0 "Chinese manufacturing has grown at an astonishing pace in the last several years, and as more factories begin manufacturing goods, we are becoming more acquainted with the finer details of running a large scale industrial economy. Due to the low price of goods and the massive chinese market, retailers are routinely running out of stock as products sell faster than they are made. Several figures in our government have recommended various methods to solve this problem. Building company housing at the factories will greatly reduce commuting times for the workforce. Building factories near the source of their raw materials will cut down on transportation costs. Clustering factories that produce individual parts of final products will make assembly much quicker and easier. These are only a few examples of the steps that are being taken to reduce waste in all forms. While each new measure only improves our efficiency by a small amount, the cumulative effect is an industry that is on par with that of other nations and is capable of supplying the massive and increasingly consumerist chinese population."
 chi.333.a:0 "We must be sure to maintain the balance between supply and demand"

 chi.334.t:0 "Eyes on the Skies"
 chi.334.d:0 "Before the five modernizations began, the most advanced electronic equipment China boasted was its small network of radar stations. Installed by the Japanese army between 1948 and 1953, the stations were intended to provide an early warning for Japan, rather than any actual protection for China. These installations weren't sufficient to cover all of China when they were built, and in the decades since then they have become outdated and decrepit. China needs a modern air defence system, and upgrading our radar network is absolutely vital to this. Even the Japanese agree that modernizing China's radar systems will increase the protection of both nations. From Beijing to Xiamen Dozens of advanced outposts are being constructed at military bases and weather monitoring stations. The existing stations have been upgraded, providing a foundation for this new network that we are building. Soon, all of China will be under the protective cover of a blanket of radio signals projected from our state-of-the-art systems."
 chi.334.a:0 "There won't be a bird in the air between Vietnam and Manchuria that we won't know about."

 chi.335.t:0 "The Warehouse of Baoding Lùyīndài Incorporated"
 chi.335.d:0 "The warehouse of Baoding Lùyīndài Incorporated is not listed on any maps of Baoding. Any inquiry into the large, inconspicuous building would reveal that it is owned by one Sun Penang, and is being rented by an audio recording tape manufacturer to store their inventory. This is the furthest a Kempeitai inspector would likely look if they became curious for some reason, but if one were to open one of the large crates that fill the warehouse, they would not find unused recording tapes, but complex computer parts and strange, almost alien machines. If one were to descend the concealed stairway in the night watchman's office, they would discover the hidden laboratory where the machines designed to crack Japan's most elaborate codes are being built. This is why the warehouse of Baoding Lùyīndài Incorporated has far more guards than one might expect, and why a barbed-wire fence was recently installed around the warehouse, and why the guards, despite being members of a private security firm on paper, are armed with the latest military technology in China. While the Japanese may approve of modernizing our agriculture and industry, they would never approve something like this. Of course, we stopped asking for their approval long ago."
 chi.335.a:0 "None of their secrets will be safe."

 chi.336.t:0 "A Midnight Raid"
 chi.336.d:0 "Three weeks ago the warehouse of Baoding Lùyīndài Incorporated was raided by a squad of Kempeitai looking for contraband. While they found nothing, the warehouse staff were almost caught off guard and evacuated the lab and staff with only hours to spare. We got lucky, but it is clear information is leaking, and we must make sure that we improve our encryption methods before our luck runs out. China had no official encryption procedures, and information security consisted of trusting those with classified information not to talk about it. The process of rewiring our phone and telegraph lines to combat wiretapping and other forms of espionage will be time consuming, but if we ever want to prevent the Japanese from knowing the contents of every message sent within our government it is a process we must undertake. To provide an extra layer of security to our communications, several newspaper word and math puzzle designers have been secretly hired to help us develop a code language that is almost impossible to decipher without a key. Once this language is finished, it will be implemented in all our classified communications, so that should the Japanese break past our encryption measures all they will find is lines of gibberish."

 chi.337.t:0 "The JJ Mk. III"
 chi.337.d:0 "The Japanese have long held the title of the greatest computer designers in the world, constantly developing groundbreaking new technologies increasing the performance and versatility of computers, and setting the standard all other nations, including China, aspire to reach. This will soon change. The JJ Mk. III has been designed to surpass all currently available computers in everything from storage space to processing speed to graphic display. However, it is not the computer's inner workings that are most inventive, but it's user friendly design. The computer replaces the previous interface method of typing commands with a visual display that utilizes a new hand operated pointing device, referred to colloquially by the team as a roller, in reference to the wheel in the device used to scroll up and down on the computer display. This design is much more intuitive than Japanese computers, and even those who have never operated computers before can achieve a basic understanding in mere minutes. While it is inevitable that this design will be quickly copied around the world, as many designs have before it, for the first time China will be the one being copied."

In Hubei, new water resistant construction machines that were developed to aid the construction of the Yangtze River Dam are being put to use is a number of other aquatic infrastructure projects. In the factories of Nanjing, a new automated crane arm capable of lifting extremely heavy products directly off of assembly lines and placing them into packaging crates has become the newest status symbol among the city's industrialists. As China continues to industrialize at an exponential rate, our engineers have begun to design their own tools to suit their needs. While Japanese tools are still in wide use, there is a growing consensus that Chinese tools are not only cheaper and easier to obtain, but are also more versatile and require less maintenance. Some would argue that a hammer is a hammer, a wrench is a wrench, and a bulldozer is a bulldozer. Those unfortunate souls have clearly never had the opportunity to work with tools bearing the Chinese stamp of quality."

 chi.339.t:0 "Construction Begins on the Yangtze Dam"
 chi.339.d:0 "The Yangtze Dam Project has never been officially labeled as the project that will mark China's full transition from the past into the present. Officially it is just another piece of infrastructure, albeit an ambitious one, designed to bring cheap electricity to central China and made possible by the continuous advancement of our engineering capabilities. However, almost as soon as the project was announced it garnered an enormous amount of attention, with the media labelling it as the pinnacle of Chinese engineering and technology. It became an important symbol to our people before the final plans even left the drawing board, a physical manifestation of China's newfound power and ambition. Today, the President of the Chinese Government himself appeared at the commencement ceremony and, following a short speech about how far China has come in so little time, broke ground on the new project. It will take over a decade to finish the dam, but it is already empowering the Chinese people."

 chi.340.d:0 "Today the Saigo no Wakare departed from Jōkai harbor. Aboard it is Asahi Suziki, an electrical engineer who has spent the past four years working to help China modernize. For Asahi, it is a bittersweet feeling to watch the Chinese coast recede into the horizon. When he came to China it was a backwards land, barely more than a massive ricefield for Japan. He and his colleagues were instrumental to building it into the modern colossus they are leaving behind, and he is rightly proud of their work. On the other hand, the last few months had made it clear that he was longer needed. While his classrooms and laboratories had once been filled with wide-eyed students eager to learn, the Chinese no longer needed lessons from a foreign instructor. They were plenty of Chinese teachers who knew just as much as him, as much as that hurt to admit. Many of the finest technicians, engineers, scientists, and architects in all of asia, finally returning home after years abroad. While their contribution to the Five Modernizations will never be forgotten, the time has come for China to shed itself of their weight and assert its full technological independence."

 chi.341.t:0 "It's Just Good Business"
 chi.341.d:0 "As the competition between Chinese and Japanese products grows more intense by the day, our manufacturing sector is taking every step possible to maximize efficiency. The factories run day and night, with workers constantly filtering in and out as their shifts start and end. Copying the methods of the zaibatsus, some companies have begun implementing extensive vertical integration. Their workers live in company housing. They listen to company radios, eat company meals, wear company clothes, and their children go to company schools. Sometimes to defeat a monster, one must become a monster, and there is no economy on earth more monstrous than the Japanese. The results of these steps are already evident. While a Chinese and a Japanese computer may be of roughly equal quality, ten computers roll off of our assembly lines for every one that they produce. The Japanese exploitation of our markets is coming to an end, and at the current rate of progress it is not unreasonable to assume that before the decade's end it will be Chinese, rather than Japanese products that are filling Asia's markets."

The people of China work with the finest tools in the world. Telephone lines and radio broadcasts reach to all corners of our nation, connecting our people and uniting all of China in a common purpose. Throughout Asia, Chinese products are sought after for their high quality and Chinese technical experts are regarded as some of the best in their fields. To describe the change Chinese society has undergone in the last few years as monumental would be an understatement. Not even the Japanese modernization of a century ago can compare to the speed with which we have lifted ourselves from the dark ages and pushed our way to the front of the global technological race. The Five Modernizations are not complete, but we now have the technology needed to reach our full potential , and all of it is designed and produced right here in China"

The exhibits display new Chinese innovations in every scientific field from cellular biology to arithmetic computing to experimental psychology. The focus of this year's conference is China's military advances, with new vehicles and equipment taking the spotlight. Among the items showcased are the Tiānlóng 105, China's domestic civilian aircraft, and the Mark 3 infrared rifle scope, colloquially referred to as a night-sight scope, which allows infantrymen to engage in low light combat with much greater accuracy. Some in our general staff are concerned that showcasing so much experimental military hardware may be compromising our secrecy, but the fact is that we are only revealing the tip of the iceberg. The exposition has caused quite the international stir, with reactions ranging from supportive to apprehensive, especially from the Japanese reporters covering the event."

These scenes would have not been out of place in the China of 1750, and yet they happened yesterday. The people of China work their fields by hand and plow, much as they did 300 years ago. Modern forms of communication are nonexistent outside of the cities. For centuries, China was at the forefront of scientific discovery. Papermaking, printing, gunpowder, the list of world changing inventions is too long to name. If we are to ever return to our former glory, we must reclaim this legacy.

 chi.345.d:0 "An expedition to locate natural resources in the Upper Shaximiao Formation has today uncovered a most wonderful surprise. Near the bank of the Tuo River, members of the team were searching for signs of possible oil deposits, only to be shocked by the discovery of a near-complete set of dinosaur fossils, preserved and protected by the surrounding clay. As a result of the unexpected yet pleasant surprise, the team called in the local Chinese authorities who in turn contacted a group of paleontologists to excavate and examine the fossils.\n\nAfter further inspection, the paleontologists concluded that the remains belonged to a new, undiscovered, species of dinosaur that is a member of the stegosauria family. This creature, after much speculation, is thought to likely have been alive in the Late Jurassic period, and like its relative the Stegosaurus, was a large, four-legged herbivore. The skeleton is about seven meters long and two meters tall, and has two rows of plates along its spine which become taller over the hip region and maintain a pear shape. Also, this specimen seemed to have four (or perhaps two?) outward facing spikes on the end of its tail in the typical thagomizer pattern that were likely used to fend off predators.\n\nA general agreement between the expeditionaries and the paleontologists as to what the name of the discovery will be has been reached. Although some wanted to give it a boring name such as that of the river it was found by, most decided on "Chuízilóng" or "Hammer Lizard" as a reference to its power and strength when it roamed these lands. Very proud of this product of China, government officials have ordered the Chuízilóng to be put on display in the nation's capital to show off this wonderful animal to the world."

 chi.354.d:0 "One of the most popular styles of music throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere is ryūkōka, a style of popular music from the Home Islands that combines traditional Japanese chord progressions and themes with modern Western instrumentation and singing styles. Its popularity rose in China after its introduction by Japanese settlers who brought with them their favorite songs from back home, as well as Japanese record labels seeking to expand their markets to new regions. But there are those in our society to whom these humble imported records have since become a symbol of quiet oppression, a twelve-inch tool of cultural imperialism.\n\nIn recent years, many juvenile delinquents, bitter ex-Chiang supporters, and other rabble-rousers have begun to vocally revolt against what they see as Japanese intrusions into the Chinese home life. Some have been more vocal than others. In Beijing, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and many other cities, these social disruptors have organized mass boycotts of all ryūkōka music. Radio stations that play it see their disk jockeys harassed on the streets by ruffians, record stores selling it are vandalized, magazines that praise it are stolen from the newsstands, and people who own it make a great show to their neighbors of throwing their collections in the trash. In a more confounding case, hundreds of people in Hangzhou piled h of records by Kiyoto Nagai, Hideo Murata, Hachiro Kasuga, and other ryūkōka singers in the middle of a baseball diamond, which they then doused with gasoline and lit on fire. When the fire brigades came to put out the conflagration, all the arsonists had long fled, leaving nothing but a giant, smoking lump of plastic and scorched grass.\n\nNeedless to say, this has caused quite a row in both Nanjing and Shanghai. The Japanese diplomats have been blowing these silly demonstrations out of proportion, with phrases like "encouraging cultural warfare" and "inciting rebellion" being thrown around with disturbing frequency. Although our men have desperately promised they will do something about it, what exactly are we supposed to do about it? Go door-to-door and put a Kyu Sakamoto album in every house?"

 chi.375.d:0 "In similar fashion to earlier meetings with the Japanese, the summit in Nanjing would open with parades and fireworks, children holding the five-barred flag in one hand with the rising sun in the other. The dignitaries would meet, shaking hands and sitting down. In the photographs it looked so jovial, a meeting between respected comrades working to assist each other in the Asian economic community. But in truth, the atmosphere is tense. In atypical fashion, Gao Zongwu himself opted to represent the Chinese government in the negotiations. The first day was inconclusive, with Gao personally deflecting any further economic deals between the two for reason of "budgetary uncertainty", a reason both sides knew to be a falsehood. After an unusually quiet working dinner, the second day's proceedings were slow still, with the Chinese delegation ultimately opting to table the "Annual Cooperation Deal" for further discussion. Now, Zongwu insisted, another matter would be discussed. He presented the delegation a treaty, running the butt of his pen over a bolded clause.\n\n"The Administration and Ownership of all rightful Chinese territories occupied by the Japanese government and her client states will be transferred to Chinese authority".\n\nAfter presenting the treaty, Zongwu remained standing. Waiting for the Japanese response."

 chi.376.b:0 "We are in no position to refuse..."

 chi.377.t:0 "The Nanjing Diktat"
 chi.377.d:0 "The Japanese delegation scoffed, laughing in Gao Zongwu's face. The Empire of Japan would not accept such ridiculous requests, and the Chinese government should be mindful of her place beneath the Rising Sun.\n\nCalmly, the Chinese President requested that the delegation depart now, as this would be their final opportunity to leave China in peace. The Japanese delegation continued with their laughter, finding humor in the sheer ridiculousness of this situation, and packed their belongings before heading to the door. The Ambassador stopped before turning to Zongwu.\n\n"You should know better, Mr. President. This audacity... I will make sure it does not go unpunished."\n\nOffering no response, Zongwu bowed before turning away. The very same sentiment ran through his mind, the thirty years of humiliation and forced subservience would not go unpunished. The modernizations have made China strong, her farms producing rations, her factories building rifles, her airports departing planes, her army standing at the ready. This would be China's greatest fight and she was ready."
 chi.377.a:0 "The past shall be avenged, the Chinese nation shall return!"

 chi.378.t:0 "The Nanjing Agreement"
 chi.378.d:0 "The delegation scanned the document diligently, Gao followed their eyes as they carefully examined the document. He cracked his knuckles in anxiety as he waited, this was it. China would get her second wind here or be crippled forever.\n\n"Bullshit. No deal." One of the diplomats, a elderly, wrinkled man threw off his glasses in rage. His colleagues shot him a colorful assortment of glances, their faces paintings of emotions. Fear, disdain, and approval. "Perhaps what my friend means to say is," One of the junior diplomats interjected, "the terms are beyond the scope of our government in its current state, I'm sure you'd understand."\n\nThe Chinese president tugged on his collar and cleared his throat, "W-well of course-" Gao stopped, his sentence still hanging in the air. Eyebrows raised, the Japanese delegation waited for Gao to finish. He looked down at the paper, then at the flag of the nation he had built from the ground up adorning the wall, and then back to the diplomats.\n\n"Of course you will sign. It is the only thing left to do." Gao was faced with scowls across the room. "Pardon me, Mr. President," the prestigious title used as a weapon, "you have no right to decide the policy of Japan." Gao leaned in closer, "I have just as much right to do so as you do China. I am not here to fight with you gentlemen, I am seeking a mutually beneficial agreement and that's what lies before you. You are here for a profit, yes? Do you expect to profit off warlord fiefdoms? Absolutely not. An organized, reunited China will be a much greater benefit than a fractured state of warlords. I implore you to sign." The Japanese ambassador toyed with the idea for a moment, whispered into the ear of an aide, and shot Zongwu a seething glare. After seemingly hours of silence, the ambassador recluantly gripped the pen, saying only, "Very well.""
 chi.378.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."

 chi.379.t:0 "A Stolen Kingdom"
 chi.379.d:0 ""I WANT A HEAD ON MY DESK!" The orders echoed through the lavish office, the Japanese flags adorning the room quivered at his commands. The officers stood at attention as their commander before them pounded on the desk, ranting and raving about the terrorist strikes haunting Japanese arms shipments. The Butcher of Singapore was in unfamiliar territory, he preferred to let his subordinates organize themselves. He dreaded dealing with the fat, corrupt, bureaucrats whom he answered to, in his own territory no less. The commander lifted his cap off the rack and stomped off to his motorcade, he wasn't going anywhere.\n\nThe citizens of Haixi had only barely begun their morning routine when the distant rumble of the engine rang throughout the valley. Tsuji tapped his foot impatiently, the rifle strung against his shoulder weighed heavy on his back. This was an embarrassment, his own province sold off to the Chinese, he would make sure this was the final confrontation. This Soon Ching, this cleansing, would be final and absolute.\n\nTsuji's car stopped in the middle of the town square, the early morning market was awakening. Hopping out of his vehicle, the Butcher of Singapore smugly strode around the area, brandishing his weapon. Six soldiers took up each side of Tusji, weapons aimed towards people within the crowd. "It has come to my attention that this city is harboring those who wish to disturb the tranquility of this province. I ask these rebel rats to step forward and face punishment for the crimes they have committed!" The typically bustling square was still, no one dared to make a noise. "No? Well, within my duties assigned to me as governor of this province, I will defend the sovereignty of this tranquil land with the utmost force." The Butcher does not bluff, and with his order to fire, the war for Hui began."
 chi.379.a:0 "One more "Banzai"..."

 chi.380.t:0 "The Hui Refuse!"
 chi.380.d:0 "Hui, the dominion of the former Japanese client states in China ruled by General Tsuji, has refused to abide by the agreement our government has made with Japan and instead seeks to fight! Though this turn of events is not uncharacteristic, it is alarming and must be put down."
 chi.380.a:0 "This rebellion will be put down with force."

 chi.381.t:0 "The Third Treaty of Shimonoseki"
 chi.381.d:0 "Battered. Broken. Defeated. What more is left? What more can this nation lose? Land? Riches? Men? Men. It would be the sons of mothers who would continuously pay the price. There is nothing more gratifying than seeing a plan come to fruition and for Chinese president Gao Zongwu, everything was coming together. Meticulous planning, backdoor deals, and sacrifices, all for what? To end back where it all started, at the table with the Japanese, never on the side of triumph, but walking in with tails between our legs.\n\nThe first treaty of Shimonoseki was a setback, something that could be recovered from. The second was painful, but renewed our spirit and the third has crushed it. There is nowhere to go anymore, how can you inspire hope in a nation that has been ripped apart by foreign nations?\n\nIt is without a doubt the Japanese have proven their superiority and we are left at their whim."
 chi.381.a:0 "Is our future damned to be that of humiliation?"

 chi.399.t:0 "A Shipment Departs"
 chi.399.d:0 "Despite what it says on paper, not all of China is under our control, hardly a majority of the lands under our jurisdiction answer to us. We often have to deal with petty warlords who crave up China for their own personal gain. On an average day, a report on a garrison slaughtered may come in from the frontier, but today something else has arrived on the desk of the president.\n\nOur efforts to increase our influence in our brother's territory have succeeded! The head of state has elected to receive our arms shipment."
 chi.399.a:0 "A pleasure doing business with you."

 chi.400.t:0 "Chinese Arms"
 chi.400.d:0 "Lines on a map aren't everything as it seems. Despite the fact that we are at odds with those who wish to use China as a tool to build their own power, they have come to extend the olive branch. Not the traditional olive branch of course, crates of weapons. Although these arms may be stamped with logos of foreign flags, they are truly our own, for they were constructed in Asia. This move of friendship will surely bring our states close together, together towards unity, towards a free China!"
 chi.400.a:0 "We will put them to good use."

 chi.401.t:0 "High and Dry"
 chi.401.d:0 "We wait and wait and wait. Nothing. Nothing at all. Our scouts reported that the designated meeting area was completely desolate. Giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming their backwards living conditions were holding them back, they waited and waited and waited. We never should've trusted them in the first place! How foolish could we be to trust those who wish to see China made in their own image!"
 chi.401.a:0 "Keep your weapons, they are outdated anyways."

 chi.402.t:0 "Turned Away"
 chi.402.d:0 "The soldiers returned back to the capitol, clearly a sign of a job well done! What a relief, with so much going on, it is hard to keep track of it all. Sadly, nothing in China is ever that easy, as the soldiers did not return empty handed. The generous offer of our top of the line weapons has been frankly denied by the petty fiefs of China."
 chi.402.a:0 "Who do they think they are?"

 chi.403.t:0 "[From.GetName] Comes With An Offer"
 chi.403.d:0 "While at a daily briefing, shortly before the meeting was adjourned, the security minister interjected with a surprising development. The state of [From.GetName] has reached out to our government requesting arms. Across the room, the security minster earned himself strange looks, but the president demanded silence. He went on to explain that while this may grant legitimacy to [From.GetName], it will also bring them closer into our sphere of influence."
 chi.403.a:0 "We can spare some arms."
 chi.403.b:0 "Our guns are our own."

 chi.404.t:0 "A Shipment From [From.GetName]"
 chi.404.d:0 ""With Love, [From.GetName]" The crates of weapons sat awkwardly on the steps on the Yuan. When the police discovered the crates that morning, it was sure to all be some kind of joke, some elaborate prank. After questioning and interrogation, a follow up report proved this not to be true. Late at night, operatives from [From.GetName] simply dropped off the weapons and slinked back into the night. Our government, puzzled, now has to figure out what to do with this generous gift."
 chi.404.a:0 "Distribute them amongst our army!"
 chi.404.b:0 "Burn them, we will not give them legitimacy!"

 chi.405.t:0 "An Unexpected Visit"
 chi.405.d:0 "A large gathering of soldiers, their uniforms adorned by the seal of [From.GetName], have arrived in the city square! Obviously an invasion is under way! That's what our officers thought at first at least. After questioning the group, they reported to have come in peace, only here to deliver volunteer teachers for our modernizing education program. While this is extremely unorthodox, if they are offering their help, there should be no harm in accepting."
 chi.405.a:0 "We'll take all we can get."
 chi.405.b:0 "We decline!"

 chi.406.t:0 "Building Bridges"
 chi.406.d:0 "In order to buy our loyalty, the central government of [From.GetName] is sending us modern construction equipment. While it is obvious that this is clearly just a bid to gain favor with our government, times are tough. With a modernizing nation such as ours, resources are scarce and if [From.GetName] is generous, or foolish, enough to donate some of their equipment, why not?"
 chi.406.a:0 "Constructing a new China, together!"
 chi.406.b:0 "This is too good to be true."

 chi.407.t:0 "The Door Slammed In Our Face"
 chi.407.d:0 "Educating China isn't just a task for our major cities, every person who lives in the borders of our great nation requires the ability to read and write. While our own programs are doing well, some spots are out of our reach, such as [From.GetName]. In an act of friendship, we sent an educational envoy of scholars to assist on building rural communities into breeding grounds for knowledge. This bright future has been denied as our teachers returned home bloody and beaten!"
 chi.407.a:0 "They won't be able to read our declaration of war!"

 chi.408.t:0 "Living Off The Land"
 chi.408.d:0 "China's industrial potential has been trapped into its major cities, with much of China left underdeveloped, much less industrialized. As part of the modernization program all of China ought to experience the luxuries of the modern world! It seems as if not everyone else shares this vision for China. Our expedition to [From.GetName] has ended in disaster! We were informed by their leader that they had no interest in our construction equipment, saying they were better off the way they were."
 chi.408.a:0 "They chose to live in the past"

 chi.410.t:0 "Successful infiltration"
 chi.410.d:0 "Thanks to careful planning and execution, our agents have secured several positions of power and influence in the [From.GetName] hierarchy.\n\nOur eyes, ears, and hands work tirelessly to provide critical intelligence. Our observations, once obscured by distance and miscommunication, now illuminate the darkest secrets of our enemies. Our reports, once composed of dubious contradictions and hearsay, now yield concrete intelligence, strengthening our position in the region.\n\nThere is still much work to be done, however. It is unlikely that our agents have gone completely unnoticed and there are undesirable limits to our influence. More time and effort is required before our actions will bear fruit. Nevertheless, this will surely be a great boon in our efforts to wrest control over China."
 chi.410.a:0 "A job well done."

 chi.411.t:0 "[From.GetName] Tried to Infiltrate us!"
 chi.411.d:0 "Whispers around the Yuan speak of an unusual man wandering around the premises, seemingly a citizen of [From.GetName]. The man, dressed in a trench coach and wearing dark glasses, has been sighted taking pictures around the Yuan. While this is nothing out of the ordinary, his repeated visits drew the attention of a goverment agent who walks past the Yuan daily while on the way to his station.\n\nWhen the man arrived once more with his camera, the agent tackled the man and brought him into the local police station. After some interrogation, the man was revealed to be an agent! Thankfully, we have stopped him from destabilizing our government!"
 chi.411.a:0 "A pathetic attempt."

 chi.412.t:0 "Unsuccessful infiltration"
 chi.412.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our skilled agents, the infiltration of [From.GetName] has developed not necessarily to our advantage.\n\nIn a surprise investigation, several of our operatives were discovered and imprisoned by the enemy. Thanks to quick thinking however, they were able to alert the rest of the team before additional assets were lost. The remaining agents were quickly extracted and are currently awaiting debriefing. Their morale is shaken and their bodies exhausted but, with time, they will recover.\n\nDespite their failure, the knowledge they acquired will be instrumental in preparing for future missions. New plans will have to be drawn up and more agents trained in order to ensure the next operation runs smoothly. It seems that, for now at least, our ambitions have been curbed."
 chi.412.a:0 "That could have gone better!"

 chi.413.t:0 "Constructing a New China"
 chi.413.d:0 "They always come crawling back. Despite the states denying our rightful status of hegemon of Asia, the state of [From.GetName] has accepted our offer of assistance with modern construction equipment."
 chi.413.a:0 "We are building more than just buildings but friendships."

 chi.414.t:0 "Bringing Up a New Generation"
 chi.414.d:0 "There is too much to learn and not enough people to teach. We are shakily stable in our education as of now but our reach of influence only goes so far. There are millions of uneducated children that we can pull into the modern world. [From.GetName] agrees with our noble goal and welcomes our teachers with open arms. Our cirriculuim will not only ensure these students have an equal chance at success but also give them a healthy dose of nationalism and pride for a free China!"
 chi.414.a:0 "Work smarter, not harder."

 chi.450.t:0 "The Anti-Corruption Industrial Subcommittee"
 chi.450.d:0 "The sky was choked with smoke. Bicycles bumbled along the street. Occasionally, a motor vehicle would peek its head above the thousands of bikes and men walking the streets. While not calm, all was normal. The government was modernizing at a steady pace. We interview Zhong Yuhan, a bureaucrat.\n\nThis must be the first time I've told my story, huh. Well, here goes.\n\nI had just joined a new subcommittee. The Anti-Corruption Industrial Subcommittee. It was an entry-level job, especially considering we did nothing but placate the reformists. We'd walk into a factory, make sure all the workers were happy - they always happened to be, coincidentally - check some fake bank papers, and leave. Japanese influence was a given, especially considering ninety-nine percent of every factory in the nation was Japanese owned. We were at a newly opened one, called the Wang Jingwei State Factory, if I recall correctly. Another routine job, another mediocre paycheck, another day with my painfully boring coworkers. We said hello to the factory overseer, a young Japanese man thoroughly entrenched in the old money of the Zaibatsus, looked over some smiling laborers, skimmed tax papers. Like normal. I grabbed the papers I needed to, got lunch on the way back, and looked through the folders. In my infinite wisdom, I realized I had taken the wrong folder. Just take it back, no big deal. But, I reasoned, nobody would care if I just took a glance. "
 chi.450.a:0 "You know, if there was anything of importance in there."

 chi.451.t:0 "The Revelation"
 chi.451.d:0 "The dozens of pages were the kind of thing that lawyers dreamed of. Over the 76 pages was every single wrong that anyone with a remote relation to a Zaibatsu committed, and future plans to continue these wrongs. They started quite simple; businessmen buying out factories for cheaper then they were worth, with implications of threats. The actions quickly ramped up, ranging from actively encouraging opium use to increase reliance on the Japanese to bribing or threatening leading government officials to pass laws with millions of Yuan. Worse still, Japanese businessmen had been taking advantage of close economic relations within the sphere to make monopolization easier; consolidating mergers across borders was easier when borders barely played a role. What had once been a piece of ice floating out in the ocean had been revealed to be the biggest iceberg in the entire world. As time and ink went on, the accounts got more and more egregious. Stated matter of factly, on paper, was support for the use of slave labor in areas subject to less surveillance. Using money, or worse, threats to cover up the rape of woman laborers were frequent matters that the Japanese dealt with. And of course, who could forget about child labor? The most revolting part, Zhong noticed, was how deeply unemotional the paper was. It was simply a ledger of crimes, nothing more. Zhong let out a deep sigh. He then proceeded to walk to the nearest bathroom and vomit."
 chi.451.a:0 "Why did it have to be him that stumbled on this pile of shit?"
 chi.451.tt:0 "§RA new Crisis Tree will be unlocked to deal with this issue.§!"

 chi.452.t:0 "The System Unfurls"
 chi.452.d:0 "I realized, in my stupor, that I had a couple of options on how to deal with this. I could turn it back in to the businessman I took it from. Forget this all happened - or try my best - and live my life in eternal questioning, asking what would have happened if I had turned it in. Or, I realized, I could take it to my supervisor and see what came of this pile of shit. Obviously, you know what I chose, because I'm sitting right here. At the time, I thought it was an idiotic move - still not quite sure why I did end up turning it into the supervisor. I'd like to think it's because it weighed on my conscience. But knowing me, back then? I thought he'd give me a bonus.\n\nStill, I was speechless when I presented the paper. Eventually, I wriggled the words out of my mouth. And in that moment I remember a particular thought I had. I found it darkly humorous that paper was our invention, yet the ink on the paper was of a thoroughly Japanese species. My supervisor did not share the same giggling sentiment, went white as a sheet of paper, and vomited in the bathroom, just as I had done."
 chi.452.a:0 "After some time in the bathroom, he returned and asked me to schedule a meeting with the central committee of Industrial Safety."

 chi.453.t:0 "The Industrial Safety Committee"
 chi.453.d:0 "The bureaucracy was slow. Two weeks after filing for a meeting with the Industrial Safety Committee, Zhong had finally gotten the news that he was to speak with them. Both he and his supervisor would present the papers to the Committee. After too many sleepless nights that Zhong had found could only be quelled by heavy amounts of jiu, he was finally going to get this over with.\n\nThe committee was located in the administrative sector of the city, a mix of housing reserved for leaders and even larger administrative buildings. There was a grandiosity to it; the buildings clean-shaven and the men walking the streets even more so. In one of the smaller buildings at the end of the central street was the Industrial Safety building. It was full of civil servants who had managed to get to a more prominent position, probably because of family ties, and disgruntled former Right-KMT leaders rehabilitated under Gao. The highest ranked officials were unelected, those who ran the Committee. Zhong followed the signs that lead to the offices of the committee member, and nodded at the secretary, who already knew his business. Entering into the committee room, Zhong found a simple open office. His supervisor was sitting on a chair against the wall, with his face in his hands. A man in the middle of some work stood up from his desk and introduced himself to Zhong. 'Chen Hsin-Chung' was his name. "I understand we have some important business to get to, Zhong." Zhong nodded, and Chen gave him a warm, reassuring smile. "I already have the papers from your supervisor, but I thought it would be best if the whole committee went over them together." Again, Zhong nodded, this time swallowing his fear. Chen gathered the rest of the members over by a conference table. The papers were taken out. Zhong explained how and when he got the papers. Finally, the committee read them. As they scanned through the documents, their faces went white in the same shade that his supervisor's had gone. Even Chen's normally unfazed expression was broken, as the scale of the situation was revealed. Chen croaked out a couple words."
 chi.453.a:0 ""We must contact the President.""

 chi.454.t:0 "The President's Rude Awakening"
 chi.454.d:0 "Gao Zongwu's sleep schedule had been off the last couple weeks. He had been loaded with work as the government continued reforming. His treasured time that he got to rest was short. This was why he was deeply irritated when he received a call in the middle of a nap. Groggy and annoyed, he almost just hung up the phone but mustered up the strength to pick it up and put the telephone to his ear. All that was said was that there was an urgent matter that needed to be attended to and that he should be ready for a meeting in ten minutes. Gao groaned with the energy of a man who hadn't slept for two days, fell out of bed, and put on the first suit he saw.\n\nProbably some jumpy administrator thought he spotted something wrong in some ledgers. This wasn't worth his time, but he was already out of bed. Gao arrived at the central administrative building and got to the room reserved for the meeting. The president had not expected to see every major diplomat and economic official stationed in Nanjing next to that former KMT member, Chen Hsin-Chung. An unfamiliar man in a shabby brown suit introduced himself as Zhong.\n\nEach one looked like they were at a funeral. Gao wondered what the situation was. Certainly, it could not be as bad as the expressions seemed to say. Chen handed him a folder that the other officials had already read.\n\nWith an explanation provided by Zhong and Chen and the proof in the papers, Gao Zongwu, President of the National Government of China, realized that he was in deep shit."
 chi.454.a:0 "At least the papers haven't leaked yet."

 chi.455.t:0 "The Papers Have Been Leaked"
 chi.455.d:0 "I probably don't need to tell you what was in those papers. I will, though, just so you get it all down. All of those rumors, about Zaibatsu mistreatment of workers? About gigantic corporate consolidations across the entire sphere? About entire towns being whisked off the map, being put in some faraway labor camp? They were all true. Every single one. And we had documents for each crime. Murder, fraud, assault, manslaughter, embezzlement. We had landed on the motherlode of reports.\n\nY'know, you've gotta understand, when you're looking at the media, the newspapers, hell, the radio, that we were trying our best. All these western standards of a press telling the honest truth, nothing but the truth, all of that bullshit. There wasn't no truth. China was bursting with stories, not the truth. Gao Zongwu was the devil, he was the angel, the Japanese, the traitors, jesus. So when on our doorstep rolls up this paper with no real authentication, no evidence for their claim, besides a few dusty papers dating from a decade ago, of course we're gonna print the damn paper. Jesus, you think your average guy is gonna buy a story about how Wang up north is opening a new shop? No, he's gonna buy the story thats screaming about how the Hanjian are destroying the country, goddamnit.\n\nFuck me if I knew that my little Luhe tabloid was about the blow the biggest scandal in Chinese history wide open. We never did learn who sent us the papers, but they turned out to be just true enough to start the goddamn Japanese Crash. You won't believe me on this, but we still don't know who sent the docs.\n\nSuddenly, within a day of publishing a few excerpts, we had sold every copy of the paper. Zhongyang Ribao and Shibao had both picked it up. Gigantic strikes immediately began in every Chinese city I could name. I'm not surprised, of course. It felt like the entire country was just falling apart at our feet. Gao Zongwu didn't step out of his office for two days. Holy shit, two days. And the Japanese? Well, they stopped squirming in those expat villages in Nanjing and jumped town. Shanghai, Manchukuo, whatever. You know all this, of course. I just still can't believe it really happened.\n\nI didn't know it then, but I, we, were at the center of this whole thing. And it was only by coincidence that what we printed was true.

 chi.448.t:0 "A Tower in Singapore"
 chi.448.d:0 "Inside the massive skyscraper towering over Syonan-to, accountants, salesmen, and calculators scrambled to get work done. In the days coming up to the expected merger, workloads had tripled. During a turbulent period like this, no jobs were secure, and layoffs were expected. Secluded from the rush, two executives sat in an office laying at the penthouse of the tower. First, the conversation was small talk; how each was doing, who married who, and any matter of unimportant events. Quickly, the attention was turned to the most urgent matter at hand, the merger.\n\nRecent laws passed in Japan, supposedly for reigning in monopolies, belied their true purpose. The laws contained multiple small footnotes that actually made mergers significantly easier for businessmen. Previous effective antitrust laws were abolished and replaced by newer ineffective ones, and tariffs were further wiped across the sphere.\n\nBecause of the lessening of tariffs, businesses could now exploit the centralization of the sphere; horizontal integration across the sphere was easier to maintain, as globalization and loosening of borders eased the movement of products from cheap factories on the mainland to Japan proper. Executives like the ones in Singapore seized on this. Oligopolies and monopolies wouldn't just be easier to create but easier to maintain dominance. In short, commodities no longer had to be produced in the countries where the market lay to keep profit margins up. In fact, making it in another country with cheaper labor would further decrease the cost of making the commodities and prove beneficial to exploitative Zaibatsu executives. China was the first main target; with one of the executives based in China and the other in Indonesia, the two would focus on cementing globalized production within the sphere and providing clients in China with only one option; Nakajima-Furukawa industries.

 chi.449.d:0 "Gao Zongwu glanced at the disorderly group he had assembled. An assembly of economists, generals, advisors, businessmen, and cabinet members, they ranged from practical Nazis to Marxists, and everybody in between. The only thing that kept them from literally being at each other's throats was Gao Zongwu, perhaps the only unifying factor in the nation. He had assembled them for one reason; to try to find a solution to the crisis at hand. Right at this moment, there were protesters outside the administrative street, educated elite fed up with Japanese subjugation. "
 chi.449.a:0 "A decision must be made."

 chi.456.t:0 "A Decision Continued"
 chi.456.d:0 "Two main factions out of the group had seemed to emerge.\n\nOne, led by reformist advisor and former government official Tao Liang, that espouses a view of distancing Chinese economic reliance on Japan. Tao Liang and his colleagues state that distancing from Japan will let the Chinese economy grow locally, increase nationalist sentiment, and prevent human rights violations that Japanese businessmen have committed.\n\nOn the other hand, Chinese businessman Mei Seiping, along with his pro-Japanese allies, have assembled a plan pushing for continued corruption and covering up Japanese crimes. Criticizing Tao's plan as dangerously unrealistic that could lead to sanctions or potentially worse and that it would doom the Chinese economy, Mei is under fire for essentially sweeping Japanese crimes under the rug. However, it is indisputably true that Mei's option would likely do well to repair Chinese-Japanese relations and that it would probably recover the current situation.\n\nAs the two groups bickered over the proper solution, trusted advisor and close friend of Gao Zhou Longxiang stood up and called for silence.\n\nCalling for a balanced approach to the crisis, he was initially shouted down. Gao called for them to listen. Zhou elaborated on making concessions to both pro-Chinese and pro-Japanese groups, though not completely siding with each one. In the end, he said that it would mean the 'best of both worlds' while avoiding the sanctions of the Chinese and the human abuses of those who supported sweeping it under the rugs. Among the group his view was highly unpopular, labeled 'entirely impossible' and a 'tightrope so thin it would cut our feet'. Even Gao seemed to regard the plan as a pipe-dream, but didn't dismiss it. After several hours of debating the merits of each choice, Gao called for silence among the group. Instantly, a tense quiet fell over the dusty, unkempt conference room. 'I've made my decision' he said, as if letting the men and women on before giving a final answer. "

The many Japanese investors, involved in every pursuit from car insurance to military production, nearly unanimously decided it was time to sell their ill-earned investments. The stock exchange, already teetering the on edge of total disaster, has collapsed in a resounding bang.

For Japanese businessmen in tall towers, oblivious to those below, sent gifts of cash to prominent members of government urging them to strip away year's worth of workplace regulation. Already, the horrendous conditions present in the manufactories of China were compounded by a disregard of both governments and employers. Yesterday, a father of two was killed in an arms factory as gunpowder ignited. The same day, a refugee from Altay who had never ceased to work for a brighter future every day of his life was slaughtered when an industrial manhole fell from dozens of feet up. A pregnant mother working to support the baby she would soon have was smashed under three tons of metal pipes, helping to unload them onto the docks for shipment.\n\nNone of these deaths matter to those leading the factories, For the numbers are up."

A somber little gathering, short enough to be unsatisfactory but not long enough to lower production rates.\n\nGu Jing was there when it happened. He saw the man jump, with peace on his face. Then, the fear and regret when the pain of the boiling metal scalded the skin straight off. A few men offered some feeble words, but they could hardly be heard among the rumblings of the factory and the cloudiness of his own mind. After a short remembrance and a five minute extension to the scheduled lunch break, the factory resumed operations."

Leaving the manufactory, Gu was not greeted by the glitz and glamour of Qingdaos' nightclubs and bars, but the sooty and choked atmosphere of the deafening industrial district. While walking home, a scream shot through distant air, only to go silent. The laborer pondered.\n\nThere was nothing home, or rather, nothing in his life holding him back. His parents had been killed during the war. His siblings lived in Shenyang, a far-away memory. His work took up all his time, energy, and passion. When he returned home to his dingy apartment, all he found was an old bed and a broken air conditioning unit. He laid on his bed and wept."

And as the news reached across the province, dissent did as well. The details of the explosion only made the situation worse; a police report leaked following the incident detailed how it was likely a result of over work on labourers and lack of safety standards. Apparently, a wrench by a exhausted worker was dropped onto the assembly line. A series of unfortunate events following this already unfortunate occurrence spiraled out of control. A Japanese overseer, sleeping on the job, ignored the warning signs and went out to drink and party in the middle of the night. When he returned, dozens of workers were dead and a factory was ablaze.\n\nNow, impromptu protests have transformed to mass gatherings dedicated to the downfall of Japanese influence. Everybody from communists to ultranationalist fascists have come to proclaim that it is time for a popular uprising against the Japanese, one that will curb the neo-colonialist influence they hold over China. Of course, these men and women cannot do. They have no place in the new industrial order being ushered in. A situation like this can easily get out of control, however.

In fact, the school beared more than a passing resemblance to the coal mines that surrounded the town. Children returned home each afternoon with coal everywhere: under their fingernails, into the seams and patterns of their hands, through their hair, and even in the boy's toes. The parents and the municipality itself had realized this peculiarity, but had decided not to take action. They were not going to be the ones to be snatched away by some Zaibatsu hitmen. The town continued on, each silent about the horror of the school, and each child silent about what they were taught each day. When one citizen decided to take anonymous action and called about the quality of the teaching institution, agents appeared the next day. They knocked on the door of each and every home, asking for who called in. Claiming that they needed more information then the anonymous tip, a well-loved man in the village was not seen the next day, or the next. In fact, he was never seen again."

There were no roads but what the traveler forged with his feet, and no worries but what was created of the mind. It was said that no man from outside the village had ever stepped in it, but this was most likely fable.\n\nAll of this changed when that cloaked man stepped in with his motorized bicycle and began making curious inquiries on the village's working men, and of the quality of the rocks underneath. Unaware of the nature of the man, each villager responded to the former, commenting on the hardy nature of each man in the village. To the latter, all the man received was shrugs and questions on why someone would care about the rock underneath. And just as quickly as he came, he left. The man in the cloak was destined to return, but not under the same circumstances. When he returned, he returned with metal machines that consumed a shining black oil and forged roads in minutes. A dirt avenue was paved into the village, and workers from below, oil seeping into their hands, began to work.\n\nAnd work they did. The mornings in the village, when the grass was wet with dew and the roosters crowed, were replaced with the rumblings of machines underground, extracting a deeply black rock. The evenings, once a time for quiet reflection and hearty dinners, were replaced with rowdy makeshift-bars that sprung up to support the worker's festering alcoholism. The afternoon, when farmers went to work and herders to herd, were replaced with backbreaking labour that choked the soul as well as the body. The village was modern."

It was clear he was experienced in the mines, and he puffed the cigarette with the regret of a man who wished he could return to the past.\n\nYeah, I was there when the Japanese Crash hit. I think the scholars back in Beijing are calling it the Nanjing Crisis or some shit. Whatever it is, it came at an inconvenient time. My sister, she had just married and was going to live with some xiangbalao (1) near Ji'an. Thought it would be good to get out of Wuhan like her. I just left middle school and entered the workforce with the optimism of a kid. Of course the crash hit just then. Shit, I still thought I had a chance. Got good grades in secondary middle school, wasn't exactly born poor or anything of that sort. Could probably yarn up some story about working from the dirt at an interview. Work my way up to become a supervisor at a factory, maybe. When Gao started subsidizing working age men to move to Hunan and start working, I jumped on thinking it would be an adventure. Apparently, it was just a scheme to get Japanese mine owners workers who thought they were making good of an opportunity. Stepped into the office in Wuhan, got a job as an overseer of a mine.

Poor boy had no idea what he was getting into. 30 hours of standing in a crowded train. Kid walked out smelling like piss with a stain on his pants. Got off the train in some station in the middle of nowhere. Sure, the hills were beautiful, but it was sweltering hot. Spent a day looking around the area - there was a little bar where the workers hung out - and went to work the next day. But instead of ordering some of my friends from Wuhan around, some Japanese hack who looks to be 100 years old or something hands me a pick without any safety instruction. At that moment, I knew something had gone terribly wrong. My naivety had led me to believe that the government wouldn't lie to me, but here I was, an overseer being handed a pickaxe. That day, I slaved away in those mines that were somehow hotter then even outside. I remember very little but the heat and that one guy fainted from exhaustion and fell all the way down the shaft. I still remember his body, all beaten up like a cartoon. That crap still stays with you. Worked a couple years there until the crash settled down and I was transferred to a mine owned by a nicer guy out east.\n\n(2) Deadly riot at a Japanese-owned Huanggang bank, a city east of Wuhan. "

But I do remember my grandfather. He served during the taiping rebellion. Believe that, huh? And I recall each night, rain or shine, he would yelp before he slept. I do not quite know what those yelps were for. Of pain in the past, or of fallen comrades. It was not until he had passed away on his deathbed that I searched under his bed for tatters of him, anything to remember that man by. I found nothing. No documents of service, no photographs, nothing. Nothing but an old Confucian book and a cricket house. Dust. I started walking after that.\n\nYou see, I never had any parents. No mother, no father. Best I know, pa was sent off to the war in Europe, the Great War, as a worker, and ma left with him. Off to do service work, like slaves in the trenches. And they just left me here with my grandad, a senile man, one who I learned to hate. But on that deathbed, I knew that I missed him for I would have no one to yell at for their crazed speaking manner. I missed him for the moments when bits of wisdom shown through him. I packed my bags and walked out, and I never quite stopped walking, looking for something. Whatever it was, I've never found it. I've never found any symbol of my grandad, or my pa and ma. "

Sure, I have a couple friends, but ever since my wife passed everything's gone so fast, it's a blur. Then, I go over to the newspaper stall and work here all the day. That's how it's been my whole life. The cigarettes are good and the baiju takes the edge, and each day I get a bed at my apartment. Things aren't fantastic, not with the Japanese at every corner, but it works for me, and what I can tell, all my Tai Chi friends.\n\nBetter than before, back in Shantong, at least. Didn't have a great childhood, for sure. My mum was the local warlord's favorite whore and my dad came and gone before I was born. One time, when I was probably 15 or so, my mother left screaming in one of the warlord's guards arms and never came back. After that point, I dropped out of the school that I was struggling in and did anything I could find around the village. Drink down by the brothel, do odd jobs for some cash.

If it doesn't you'll sure wish it did. Three of my closest friends murdered of it. By the end of my time in that den, I was a sack of bones and skin, white as a cloud. Only thing that ever saved me was the army. Conscription started and I began fighting for Chiang. I don't mind too much politics, but that man was an idiot. Pulling cash out of the national bank and giving it to friends and allies. Never did much help, huh. Still ended up under the Japanese boot.\n\nAm I happy? Sure, I'm happy, or as close as anyone can get. The government's stabilized for the first time in history, and the economy is trying to. My wife is dead but I've got friends in people and alcohol.

And not anything minor, mind you. The Japanese guy who leased the facility was using Chinese as slave labor. Little did I know, a good friend of mine and a coworker was getting no wages, and being forced to sleep on a straw mat at an old building outside the arsenal. Apparently I was a good enough worker that I got to go home every night and see my family. They weren't so lucky.\n\nOne of those days at the Chongqing Arsenal was quite peculiar, I distinctly remember. Many of the men I usually saw working - who I would later learn were slaves - did not show. Except for one. In he came, smiling as if it was his last day before retirement. He walked up to the leaser's office, the Japanese man. Then, he blew up. Must have taken a grenade from the arsenal. For some godforsaken reason, the Japanese overseer survived. And he made his workers work harder then ever for less than ever. For years they toiled in that arsenal. Each day, they returned more sickly and pale then ever. My naive goddamn head thought they were just dieting. Dieting, you hear that! So many died in that arsenal.\n\nI'm sure you'll hear this echoed again and again through your interviews, but the government wasn't hard enough. That businessman got to walk free, albeit exiled from China. Those families never got much of anything besides a meager pension. And deep in Chongqing Arsenal, that man's body still lays, in ashes."

Gao has brought it to the Yuan and plainly stated that every man and women in that chamber must support it. There was one issue. That paper, in short, told me and everyone else to avow the pardoning of a number of Japanese officials involved in an industrial accident that killed two hundred. Two hundred people. More then the little village I grew up in. But who was I to oppose it? Who was I to put my foot down and say no to Gao? That would put me in the back of a cell, or worse, at the gallows.

He told me to wait there and he walked out to see who was there. I waited twenty minutes or so, thumbed through a couple of his books; he had a fantastic bookshelf, y'know. When he returned, his face was as white as a ghost. Without a word, yet with his mouth agape, he fell into his chair and stared at me, death in his eyes. Quietly, in little more than a whisper, he recounted his meeting. The man had told him that he must support pro-Japanese legislation coming up. If he didn't, he said, they knew where his family lived.\n\nThe legislation came and went. That parliamentarian voted it down. He voted it down! The next week, he had reportedly killed himself.

It's versatility, yet it's simplicity. In the right mood to accompany it, it's a bit magical. Anyway, to the subject we were on. It was just an unspoken rule. If you were going through papers and a Japanese name came up, or worse, a Zaibatsu office came up, you gave them a little break. Twenty percent or so off all their taxes. People blame the slaves they hired, the criminal rings they administer, the brothels they run, but I think it's a lot more simple then that. It's the taxes. Y'know what? Let's play a game.\n\nLet's say that you're - and of course you're not, but let's just say that you are - a Japanese businessmen. You're scouting out locations to suck villages dry of their men and resources, and you finally settle down in a little southern town to open up your mine. Yet, you aren't making enough money. Not enough to send back to your family back in Yokohama. With your great influence, how are you going to cut down expenses? You're already paying your miners nothing, and selling their coal back to them for egregious prices. With your influence, there's one thing you can do. Pressure the governments to tax you less!

 chi.475.d:0 "Now, there's this idea kept alive by Japanese businessmen that tax breaks revitalized the economy. That's a load of bullshit. When you give tax breaks to the wealthiest, it does nothing but make the wealthy richer. Just because you gave Koyata Iwasaki (1) three billion yuan doesn't mean he's going to give it to his oh-so-dear workers. You want to know the secret to revitalizing the economy? Give tax breaks to the ninety-nine percent of people that occupy the nation. Been proven again and again by people a lot smarter than me. Yet, that propaganda worked during the crisis. If anyone ever argued that the Japanese weren't paying for fair share, they'd quickly be shot down by just uttering the word 'supply side'. Then, of course, they'd literally be shot down by some Zaibatsu agents. (The taxman laughed. He was a fan of dark humor, apparently.) People only pay attention to the parts of the crisis that make them vomit in horror, and - I'll say this again and again - it was the parts that were buried under layer and layer of bureaucracy that wounded China the worst.

For me, however, it was bad news. My main customers, after all, were Japanese. Few in China didn't have an old chair or painting lying around. But the Japanese, see, a few of them are ardent Sinophiles. Not surprising, considering their entire culture is stolen from us. And they eat my stuff up. When half the Japanese people in (redacted) left, I lost half of my business. Unfortunate, but it sure is worth it. Have you read those papers? Horrific stuff. I didn't know that that elderly Japanese man who entered my store each saturday was directly responsible for the death of three boys. I think he was killed by a mob. Honestly, I understand it.

Shanxi is his home, and he intends to keep it that way.\n\nThe Nanjing Crisis? Don't get me started. Gao, the Japanese kiss-ass, gave them everything they wanted and more. But he did get them out of here. Before the Japanese came and occupied, y'know, we were just a quiet little village. Mao (1) and his cadre came in, but they didn't try to force too much. As long as we didn't stir up trouble, the CCP wouldn't bust us. Funnily enough though, I took an interest in Communism. I thought radical change was needed to end the era. Maybe in another world, it did. Turns out all that was needed was a Japanese invasion. Anyway, I served in the army, in the united front. Served well against the Japanese and the collaborators. Now, it looks like we're all collaborators. (He laughs, but it's a pained laugh.) I thought it wouldn't be that much of a change. The Zaibatsu's couldn't exploit every damn village. And yet, they did. Turned our quiet mountain farm town into a coal town. New guys came in, from all over the sphere. Gao kicked them out, but the scars remain. The mines are still open, and I suspect it'll never change. But all the foreign miners left. The spirit of our village remains,\n\n(1) Former Chinese communist leader, based in Shanxi"

I've got an interesting perspective, I think. If you'd like to hear it, of course. (We nodded our heads fervently.) Well, see, I was outside of Jakarta when the crash hit. It wasn't in the news much - to be honest, I didn't read the news anyway - and we didn't really feel the effects for sometime. An issue quickly arose, however. All the Japanese businessmen and Zaibatsus based in China who left? They needed another place to find cheap labor that they could exploit. You can probably guess what they found. Yup, Indonesia. For us, the situation prior to the crisis never really ended. The colonialism went on, the near-slavery that the Japanese enforced went on, and villages stayed poor, simply ingredients to the Japanese colonial pie. I had enough bullshit working on the plantations. Saved up whatever I could get and boarded 3rd class to Honk Kong. Made my way up here and I'm never going back. Gao did wonders in getting rid of the worst of them. Now, I'm making real money and making a life out here. Sure, I miss my family back home, but not enough to go back to that Japanese-ruled hell hole."

When the crash hit, I got involved with a group of kids and a few older who were starting a little bit of a political gang. Really far on the left. Schismed after one of the kids was hanged for leaving some anti-Japanese graffiti. Man, it was not good. Sometimes, it felt like they were just using it to justify the drug dealing they did. But I thought it was hot shit back then. Almost got shot running away from the police back then. Now, I'm back on track, but I'll never truly recover. A little bit of an old normal is back, and for that,\n\n(Author's note: while talking to him, he began to walk away at an increasing pace. We left him alone once he told us to fuck off.)"

His largest frustration is not being able to write everything down in the city of Beijing.\n\nMuch of the industry was given direct order by the government - and in select cases, Gao himself - to only report on specific events that the government ordered us to. It was really quite an interesting time. While massive riots took place outside of embassies and factories, we reported on those few native Chinese factories that opened up during the crisis. It's actually created something of a myth surrounding the crisis; instead of picturing massive events like the Huangang run or the Manchurian Border disaster, the normal citizen thinks of Chinese factories opening to happy laborers and fanfare. I was opposed to the tightening of reins; press should give the public all information and let them sort it out, not give them an opinion. Of course, it was probably necessary to keep crowds in check, but that doesn't mean I liked it.\n\nWhere was I during the crisis? Reporting on events out west, funnily enough. Doing some photography in Xinjiang and Gansu. I had to come back quick when the crash hit immediately, though. I was worried an old Japanese friend of mine was in danger, and the newspapers needed everyone back out east reporting on it all. I fared mostly fine. If anything, business boomed, even if there weren't as many people buying the papers."

Stocky and well-built, he is not one to fight.\n\nThere's this whole perception that every Japanese factory owner was a terrible rapist or murderer or some shit, and it's completely wrong. Sure, there were more than a few bad eggs, but there were just as many businessmen paying fair wages with good benefits. But the public - and Gao - decided it would be best to throw the whole carton on the ground as opposed to going through each one to check which was spoiled. It's a shame, really.\n\nLast I heard of my former boss, he was begging on the streets of Nagasaki. Lost everything after the crisis. And here I am, cushy job with a cushy seat.

He's off his shift and going to eat dinner with his family.\n\nSo, you two youngsters are doing an oral history on the Nanjing Crisis? That's interesting. Especially interesting since you happen to be talking to me. I was intimately involved with the full affair. Sure, I was always opposed to the government's hands off approach. When I first saw those papers, before the leak, I was horrified. Vomited more than a few times. Considered quitting - took a long break once the news broke. It was a nightmare. Then, even after seeing the terrible contents of those papers, the government decides to let them continue? I don't think I'll ever forgive them for that. But you gotta hand it to them, it worked. The economy managed to limp through. I got to keep my job. I stayed mostly under the radar through the whole ordeal. Half the government was being fired. I would say that the only thing that stopped me from being sacked was my acquaintance with Gao and the fact I didn't make myself apparent through the crisis. After all, you can't just fire a lowly civil servant, right? What were they going to do, accuse the leaks on me? I'm telling you, some Burgundians must have got their Nazi hands on it. I sure as hell wouldn't let those get out so quickly after discovery.\n\nAnyway, yeah, Gao kept my name out of the news and probably saved my life because of it. Do you know how many assassination attempts there were to him through the crash? Enough where I can't count them on my own fingers, I know that. Nice guy, but a bit too idealistic. This world is for those with pragmatism, and while Gao was realistic, he gave the Japanese more credit than they were due. And as a result, I saw the very men mentioned in the papers as running brothels and slave mines walking free on the streets of Nanjing.\n\nMy name? I don't think you'll recognize it."

(Laughing) I had had a particularly long night, and I woke up grouchy and tired. When I heard that there was more news, I just groaned and got up. It was not until I received a briefing that I began to feel sick. It was not a great time for any of us, but knowing that I had to deal with it didn't positively reflect on my psyche. Zhou Longxiang, I think it was, he offered a solution, one that seemed so out of reach, but so tantalizing. A balanced approach to the monumental task. I never thought it would work, but here we are, in a China that's struck a balance between foreign investment, it's own state. I think that's one of my proudest achievements in the state. But we must always remember - and if you were to put anything in this book, this would be it - I did not transform China. I never strived to. "

 chi.484.d:0 "When the businessman was kicked out of China, there was a vacuum in the town. He didn't just act as the leader of the factory; he also acted as a representative as the suburb. Lucky me, I got the chance to fill his space. Coworkers liked me and kind of just put me on the pedestal. Issue was, I didn't have any experience with finances or leading. So I appointed some guy to deal with the money side, and I just kind of sat in an armchair and acted nice. Wait, you're not going to put this in the book, are you? Okay, good. So yeah, maybe I do feel bad for the Japanese businessman. It's not like I ever got up to anything good around here. Wages are the same, benefits are the same.

 chi.485.d:0 "We meet him as he's off duty, a reserve man.\n\nI'd say the largest loss following the reforms of the Nanjing Crisis was easily how the military backslided. All the Japanese generals and theorists, the ones who had shaped sphere doctrine for decades - even before the wear they were highly influential - left. China was a hotspot of intellectual thought, including theoretical military thought, and it stopped as soon as all the royally educated military theorists left.\n\nThe Chinese military was left on it's own to forge it's own path. And they turned to the ancients. The generals read Sun Tzu, Jiang Zhiya, Wei Liaozi, and all the other ones of the classics for the first time since their childhood. With fresh, adult eyes, the ancients revived Chinese military thought. So even if we lost the valuable insight of the Japanese, we created a new breed of strategy, one that dominates the field. And one that will dominate East Asia for years to come."

 chi.486.d:0 "Initially, we were concerned about this interview. We wanted to hear people's stories, not their opinion on how the crisis was a result of Chinese marketing affecting the stocks. We made sure to tell him this before the interview.\n\nBefore the crash, I dabbled a bit in stocks, per my profession. And Chinese stocks were booming before the crash. Really, truly, I had absolutely no foresight. Looking back now, it's obvious the market was oversaturated; companies that did nothing but sit there and occasionally yield some coal were becoming some of the largest corporations in the sphere. A few Keiretsus went public. If you invested in them early enough, you were already crazy rich. I was living in a Nanjing penthouse. Had an American sports car that I managed to smuggle in. Parties all night during the weekends that were the talk of the town. Fuck, I had four homes scattered across the sphere. The strangest part is, I wasn't the only one. It seemed like a third of every urbanite in China had found a fortune and were saving it for as long as they could.\n\nIn the days up to the crash, the parties only got bigger and bigger. I was in vacation out west, in Yunnan, when the crisis hit. "
 chi.486.a:0 "In a moment, everything was gone."
 
 chi.487.t:0 "An Interview with an Economist Cont."
 chi.487.d:0 "I returned home to Nanjing with empty pockets and found a penthouse that had been repossessed. Funnily enough, my American sports car had not been due to how it had been illegally smuggled in. I was forced to live in a convertible for a couple of months before I found a job at Nanjing University teaching as an assistant professor. As the crisis quieted down, Chinese businessman realized something; now that Japanese businessmen were gone, the economy would be significantly more stable. So in the strangest turn of events I had ever seen, the markets boomed for a short amount of time. And in that time, fortunes were made. The parties resumed, and the penthouses of Nanjing were occupied. This time, I declined to indulge. I had seen the writing on the wall. The economy was only stable with safe investing; wide reporting on the stability of stocks meant that hundreds of thousands oversaturated in the market. My dear economist friends were again delegated to the streets."

 chi.488.d:0 "You see, what was nearly as damaging as the original pull-out of investors was the sanctions Japan put on China immediately following it. Native Chinese industries being formed needed as much support and as much money as they could get. The Japanese cut off half of all Chinese exports for some time, and the entire economy was ground to a halt. The universities lost funding from the government, and I was screwed over as well. The only thing stopping the entire economy from irreversibly collapsing were subsidies from Gao that replaced some of the losses incurred by the Japanese pulling out. If it weren't for him, we'd all be living in farmland now. "

He will not do with anything dirty for his dear customers.\n\nThis cafe has been open for as long as my grandfather's grandfather could remember. They say it's the first restaurant in Beijing. I wouldn't bet on it to be honest, but I do know it's old. See that painting on the wall? That's my great-great-great grandfather. He was a court official. Opened this place up for soldiers to eat at. Sometime in the early Qing, I reckon. Technically, I'm shouldn't even be doing anything in here, as it's old enough to qualify as a historic monument. There's some old chairs here - i'm not sure where they went, i'll look later - that date back all the way to the Yuan, I think. Could probably make a fortune off of those. Anyway, this what was left to me.\n\nIssue was, during the crisis, a mob of angry Chinese guys came on over and demanded I hand over ownership of the place to the Chinese, and get out of their country. Now here's the thing. I ain't Japanese. These guys, in all of their mob-fueled anger, couldn't hear my speaking perfectly composed Mandarin. If they did, they ignored it in the name of the crowd. They burned down half of the fucking place until I got ahold of the police and they shut it down. A mess, that was."

 chi.490.d:0 "So after the mob went to sleep for the night and the police had broken up the night owls, there was now that big massive issue I had nearly forgotten about; the fire had gone out, but half of the building had burnt down. Worse, I received a number of anonymous calls threatening to kill me. How they continued to ignore the fact that I was quite clearly born and raised in China still blows my mind to this day. I got my shotgun, hid in my room above the place, and managed to shiver asleep.\n\nI awoke to a sharp knocking on my door. I got out of my bed - and I remember this as if it was yesterday - had my eyes on my shotgun leaning against the wall in the corner and opened the door, sure it was the last time I was going to wake up. You're not going to believe this, and that's fine with me. It was a goddamn Japanese detective! And in perhaps the first instance of the Japanese ever doing something good for this country, he was here to help!\n\nI moved to a little hotel to escape the, yknow, constant death threats. A few police officers went over to watch the shop in the days I was away. A few angry guys tried to loot the place, but once they saw the guns they walked away. In about a month, there was a community effort to clean the place up."

The person who sent the note claimed to have played a key roles in the uncovering of the Nanjing Crisis, but he did not state his name. It was not until meeting him in Nanjing, as he got off his government shift, that we learned his name.\n\nYup, I'm Zhong Yuhan. Gao got me in the press earlier in the crisis, but people seemed to forget about me. I tried to stay irrelevant; I didn't want to get into history book in association for this. And to some extent, it worked. I'm not exactly a household name, though I might be familiar to most. What do I think of the crisis? I think the government handled it nearly as well as they could, but I would certainly appreciate if they could maybe lay it on a bit harder to the Japanese. Sure, they charged a few of them with the most egregious crimes, but not everything was in those papers! There were still Japanese businessmen who had raped women and shot children walking streets without a blink from the government. Imagine that. Imagine that. I have to admit, though, that they certainly fixed the economic troubles.\n\nFrom that standpoint, Zhou Longxiang was right, even if it wasn't entirely ethical. Who knows, in the end it may have given people more bread then it gave Japanese businessmen cash. If it did, then I can at least die happy knowing I did a good thing with those papers. However much I vomited or fainted or shit my pants, at least I got those papers out."

He sips a black coffee and leans back in his chair, peering at us through those wire glasses. Every inch of your skin feels as if it is being analyzed and categorized in one graceful, sweeping motion. There is a man of truly momentous scale. His times of leadership are long gone, but he can still move a thousand ships and a billion men with that commanding yet gentle voice. His stature is elegant yet casual. In history books, they speak of great men that decide the passage of time and who rules it. This is one of those men."

In all honesty, I thought they would just take the Japanese money and shut up. Instead, they did the exact opposite; the right move, considering what was in those papers. Immediately after the papers leaked, they began arresting the worst offenders and deporting or kicking out the rest and sending them back to Japan. I have to say, I'm impressed; those papers had more then just a short-term effect on me. Especially considering I'm the one who discovered them. (He laughs, as if he's said this before.)

With my pack and dress shoes, I took one look at my old house and started what I like to think of the substantive part of my life. I don't quite keep track of where I head to. I think it was Guizhou first, in those minority villages.\n\nThen Sichuan. Chengdu, probably, but I don't quite remember. Yunnan - the mountains down there are beautiful. But it was not until I headed to the far, far west that I truly began to love the road, the journey. The Tibetan Plateau, Buddhism. Xinjiang, a place that felt more like Jerusalem then Nanjing. I walked the streets of Kashgar only a few months ago. Not sure how I passed as anything but a Chinese man, but the beef noodles there were better then anything out east.\n\nThe mountains, where Tajiks fleeing from Russia mixed with the Uyghur mountain people. And what I had not noticed was something I had noticed near-universally. The fear of the Japanese that pervaded every corner of the Chinese conscience. For, even though the Han in Xinjiang threatened the very state of East Turkestan, they lived free under the stars. In the city of Kashgar, where the roads turned left and right and were interrupted by overhangs and cheap mopeds."

Close enough to the border where every morning I would wake up and hear gunfire from the Russian side. Not sure why I was there. I guess I had heard that the water was sweet and there was money to be found. Ended up getting involved with the business of some communist group over there, but that's a story for another time. I was walking further north to some lake, and my dog... she, she died on the spot. Collapsed. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't young, but she was my girl. I had met few - in fact, noone - who I felt as connected to as her. And there she was, dead on a road out in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere. I picked her up and walked east. And it just happened that the Japanese crash hit just right when my dog died on that road.\n\nI returned, after months of walking, to an unrecognizable China. My village, the hamlet on the outskirts of Chongqing, was left in the dust after the Japanese were forced out. Chongqing itself? In a similar situation, reeling from the crisis. My friends were gone, dead or enslaved in the mines that were left. Those lucky enough to escape begging on the streets. In every place I looked, I had nothing left,"

Overzealous, head in the clouds politicians. Yuan Shikai and his delusions of grandeur shattered China into a million pieces. Kai-Shek with his desire to bring the rising sun back down to Earth. Where did that get us?\n\nThe solution to the problems facing China does not lie hidden in some ancient text, there is no great mystery on how to fix a broken land. Work. Hard work done hand in hand with our brothers in the Sphere. The western powers humiliated us like no other. Nihon's invasion was not an insult but a wake up call, a plea for China to not masquerade as a western nation but to fully embrace a pan-Asianist ideology.\n\nJapan is the dominant power in Asia, why should we waste lives and money in challenging their authority when they reach out to us with open arms?

Not only is it a scornful insult to degrade the proud people of China by doubting their competence, but it is foolish to assume that so much could be accomplished in such a short time without the aid of those offering. For all of his shortcomings, Zongwu's push for industrialization is commendable, though there is no reason this should entirely come from the coffers of China. As he progressed further and further into madeness with dreams with of a fully liberated China rising from the ashes so soon after it's fall, all while creating more enemies is foolish at best and idiotic at worst.\n\nThe complexity of the five modernizations means it's not feasible to pick and choose what works for us and what doesn't. Obviously, China should be a prosperous nation, a literate nation, and an advanced nation but is sinking the economy, feeding ideology to children, and giving our neighbors the cold shoulder a fair price?

Gongbo questions however, what has Zongwu ever done to improve China? Abandon her allies and spend through the roof.\n\nSadly, the failures of Gao's government aren't apparent to everyone.

Chen Gongbo reached into his pocket and retrieved a carton of premium cigars, the best blood money could buy. Lighting up and leaning back, Gongbo retired into his chair, soaking in the stillness of the room. He took a long drag of the cigar, puffing smoke out with a hearty breath. He leaned back, his eyes closed and began to gently massage his temples, could these headaches get any worse? Three soft raps echoed out from the mahogany door, prompting Gongbo to lay down his cigar and let out a deep sigh. "Yes? Come in, you have already ruined my solitude." The door did not gently swing open to reveal a sheepish intern, asking for the President's input, but rather a military cap leaned in instetad. Gongbo raised an eyebrow, "Can I help you?"\n\n"Mr. Chen, your country calls for you." The Chinese president furrowed his brow, "Excuse me, you will address me as the President of this republic and nothing less. Who is this? Come in." The man stepped in, but not alone.

Tightly packed into the Yuan, a colorful assortment of soldiers, politicians, and diplomats clambered around. "I DEMAND MY RIGHTS! Will you get the fuck off me?

The occupants fell to hush and eyed each other at the defendants cries.\n\n"You are accused of using your status as President of the Republic Of China to plot against the government, with the goal of forwarding the interests of foreign powers."

The fucking moon?"\n\n"You are accused of treason and acting outside of the best interests of China, this tribunal finds you guilty and orders you to be shot." The thrashes of the defamed president became more violent and his screams louder as the Yuan cheered on the officers picking up the man, dragging him outside to the steps of the building. His once powerful persona gone, crushed and killed by the same methods he had employed on his enemies. "Don't shoot me! Please!" His hoarse voice echoing out, "Do not kill me..."

All factions within the Legislative Yuan are aware of this need for a new path, that China cannot succeed in the modern world without change, but the progress made by our government was not permitted a chance to blossom and the L-KMT, a relic of a failed China, has clawed its way out of the past in an attempt to usher in their own brand of change. The finishing blow for our government came when a no confidence vote successfully passed through the assembly.

His seething gaze turned to that horrible little rat Zemin, did he not understand that change was in progress? He would stand up and detail exactly how cooperation with the Japanese put China on the fastrack to modernization and that Zemin and his idealistic idiots had no plan for dealing with the pressing issues.\n\nBefore the President could illustrate the strides made in crafting China into a modern state, legislators began shouting over him. Accusations flew across the assembly, legislators decried the government as being subservient to the Japanese. Tensions escalated even further when supporters of the government reminded the opposition of the fate of the Generalissimo and his disastrous, disorganized government. The open animosity between the two factions reached its climax when a portrait of Kai-Shek was defaced and set ablaze leading to a physical confrontation between two junior legislators. For Jiang Zemin and the opposition, this was the final straw.\n\nZemin strode up to the podium, demanding complete silence. For two hours, Zemin layed out a compelling narrative following Zongwu and his illicit dealings with the Japanese. Outraged, the assembly immediately charged Zongwu with corruption and a vote of no confidence was called shortly thereafter and easily secured enough votes to pass. In lieu of the violence, the now former president Zongwu was escorted out of the building by armed guards in shame, sentenced to be confined to his house. President Zemin has announced his intentions to speed up the Five Modernizations and reanimate the dream of the republic that many believed died in Chongqing."

Members of the Old Guard and the Reformist Branch of the KMT alike shuddered as the implications of this turn of events hit them. The modernizations would halt, relations with Japan would normalize, and the trend of concessions to Japan present decades ago would continue. With a slight majority and some creative legal council, the Japanophile Legislators passed the impeachment of President Zongwu in favor of a new candidate to be elected in the near future. The language of the dictat was vague but it was already apparent who Zongwu's successor would be: former president Chen Gongbo, disgraced politican turned Japanese lapdog.\n\nAll Zongwu could do was sit quietly, allowing the triumphant Japanophiles to do their prideful reading the measure's passage uninterrupted.

The votes were counted and the newly elected President Gongbo was invited to the stage.\n\nFrom the hall's rear Gongbo entered, walking down the aisle with a slow stride. His shoulders were level, his eyes clear, and a demon's smile ripping across his face. All the minority KMT members could do was watch as China's newest President passed by enroute to assume his office once more. China's snake stepped up to the podium and after baiting applause spoke to the assembly.\n\n"It is my pleasure to serve as the President of this government once more and, as I have always done, serve the interests of the Sphere. The previous administration's folly was its unwillingness to see the benefits of our Japanese partners and to accept the mutually beneficial doctrine of Pan-Asianism.

 chi.3000.d:0 "Behind the thick smog that consistently hangs over the Nanjing skyline is a city pained to the bone. Years of fighting had once again rocked the former capital city and once again the devastation is apparent. Beyond riverside shanties and Japanese barricades, at the foot of Mount Zijin, the tomb of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen sits adorned with webs of high-explosives. The Central Army Band plays the closing notes of Kimigayo as the charges are detonated. When the dust had cleared and the rubble had settled, there sits the twelve-pointed sun, split in two across the shattered sarcophagus.\n\nGao Zongwu, former President of China, sits on his knees facing a crowd of onlookers. A cool breeze lists through the air, stirring his tunic to drape over his weakened figure. His hands are bound at the wrist and his ankles chained to the wooden floorboards below, securing him firmly in place as he awaits the presiding officer's call. The commander of the Jōkai garrison speaks to Zongwu in Japanese, requesting last words.\n\nZongwu does not respond. His eyes slide shut and he fills his lungs deeply. The polluted air stings his lungs, something that he had never experienced before the modernizations. Had he made a mistake, betraying Chiang? Would he have lived better if he too fell in Chongqing? Had this work, so desperate to bring China into the modern era, been a way of coping with that guilt? Now, lying below the executioner's sword, the squabbles of his life mean nothing. The officer shouts something but Zongwu cannot not make it out. As the blade cuts his nape, he can almost feel a plum blossom skirt across his cheek with the wind."

 chi.3001.d:0 "Zhen woke up to the sound of gunfire, and yet he barely stirred. Hung was on watch today, and Nuo was shooting targets. Breakfast was being made, and judging by the glutinous smell in the air, it was sticky rice. Stores were running low, and today was raid day, but that could wait. This was the one day Zhen was given the privilege of sleeping in. An old radio played some Chinese songs from before the war, and he wished he could go back to sleep to those melodies. But once Zhen awoke he was unable to go back to sleep. There was no point in tossing and turning in his cot.\n\nGrabbing a chunk of nearly finished glutinous rice, he made sure his rifle magazine was full of bullets and prayed they would work when the time came. A Hanyang could only fire so many times before it broke. A little bow to his ancestors for his brothers-in-arms. He had been given the honor of leading the raid. He didn't deserve it, not after Tu had died, but he was given it nevertheless. The only map they had of the village could no longer be trusted. It dated back decades. Change in the country took place glacially slow, but not that slow. It would have to do. Like the rifle and the radio and the pots and pans and the commander himself, it would have to do. Even if everything failed, he would still have loyal men and brothers of the Kuomintang to fight for him."

 chi.3002.d:0 "They watched from the hill. The villagers, going about their daily lives. The homes were wood and dirt, half collapsing. A cement building in the centre had a flag that stood still. There was no wind today. The big man strolled around, smiling and greeting residents. Smartly dressed, with a pin of the flag of the false republic on his breast pocket. Bastard. There was something too confident about him. It was the first time he had ever felt anything like it, but Zhen had a nagging feeling in his heart. Courage, most likely. To his fellow raiders, he pointed to the food stores, down the hill, to the south. When each had given him an affirmative, they yelled some words that had lost meaning to each one a long time ago and charged. He was not surprised why the peasants called them the beasts of the mountains. They fit the picture; dirty, clothes tattered, teeth bared. They were beasts, but beasts with a righteous cause.\n\nAmong the cracks of guns, Zhen could hardly think. He could see villagers going down like flies, but he did not meet any resistance. Zhen stole a glance at the storehouse and commanded his brothers to take the food and get out. The nagging feeling remained, but now was not the time for it. The villagers were still screaming and there was still work to do. Quicker then he thought, his men emerged from the storehouse with panicked looks on their faces. He understood why there was no resistance. The storehouse went up in flames before his men could get out. Out of all the screams, it was only theirs that he could hear. There was no resistance because it was a trap. Zhen finally knew what that nagging feeling was. It was not courage or ferocity."

Suddenly, he paused and looked back at Fohai with a luster in his eyes. "Have you met Paula yet? Where is she, anyway? I feel as if I haven't seen her since yesterday."\n\nFohai stared back at Falkenhausen and furrowed his brow.

Not quite humans, living in caves and unhidden to the everyman's eye. They lived and died by the rifle. Each one had renounced material possessions, that capitalist tool, in favor of two little books written by their Chairman Mao. Their lanterns had long run out of fuel and their radios broke.

An endless exodus in a nation so large the plains and mountains and forests went on for days. Their enemies were many and great, and the distances greater. They had fallen asleep in the middle of the day, exhausted from each and every trek. One snuck into the food stores for a meal, and fell to his knees. It was all gone, save for a few crumbs. Whether it was a beast, or a man, hardly mattered. The efforts of a years worth of honest farming and a half years worth of righteous stealing was gone.\n\nEven this was not enough to destroy the holdouts. They had braved worse. The tragedy that followed boded the true collapse. It was not supposed to come to an end this way. Each one had envisioned a bold end, fighting to the death in the land they loved. So when the man went to bed hungry and depressed, with his comrades, they were not expecting an attack in the rudest of times.\n\nThe police were first. Two villagers out hunting had seen a camp being set up, and reported it to the local officers. The officers had reported it higher up, and before anyone knew, an army unit was on it. Bursting in while they slept on straw and dirt, each communist was dead within minutes. Dirtied and sleeping on straw, the dead men did not much look like gods."

The Tachuan co-op started in life as a simple village cooperative shop. Buying goods in bulk to deliver cheap prices to its members it was a source of small luxuries for the villagers, as well as a community meeting place for the young, the old and the financially challenged. The co-operative became a mutual fund when it gave a young couple a small loan to start their own farm. The investment was sound, and soon the cooperative started issuing loans to people across Anhui province.\n\nThe Tachuan co-op and mutual aid bank has doubled in size over the last year, all while keeping it's democratic organisation, it's local focus and it's commitment to community wellbeing over the pursuit of endless profit. With new branches in the neighbouring villages of Hongcun and Xidi the bank has changed its name to the Social Credit bank. It takes its name from it's unusual method of issuing loans and handling credit. It decides on who to give loans based not on financial history, but the accounts of their neighbours. A young farmer who has had his loan application rejected by three city banks came to Social Credit, and a quick interview with his neighbours found him to a hardworking and trustworthy soul. They gave him the loan and he hasn't missed a payment since.It gives out overdrafts and sets interest rates to reward good citizens and reward businesses that work for the common good. Most notably, the Social Credit bank has issued an interest free loan to a Hangshi doctor to set up a village surgery in Tachuan.\n\nIn a time of growing social stratification one thing brings hope to the peasantry of Anhui. Everyone, from the free farmer to the single mother, the smiling child and the toothless elder agrees. Social Credit is a wonderful thing!"

Despite lack of equipment, popular support, and military experience, these disorganized brigands have won a baffling victory and deposed General Lu Han. His current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nWe wish to make it clear that the Republic of China Army is more than capable of crushing a feeble horde, but it would be foolish to discard preparation in its entirety. As such, we humbly request the temporary expansion of the Chinese military to crush this inconsequential nuisance.

In the minds of those far from the war, Long Yun is already defeated.\n\nThe truth, on the other hand, is far more ugly. Most Chinese soldiers are under equipped in both arms and knowledge. Officers prefer to waste wages of fictional men in brothels than train their troops. Generals spend more time planning parties than strategies. Every night, disgruntled conscripts, fed up with poor pay and conditions, leave quietly to try their luck under the leadership of Long Yun.

Very little of it would ever make it to the frontlines for use, but that was of little concern to the manufacturer; they had their yen.\n\nYes, everything here was built for the lowest cost, sold to the Japanese government for the highest price, and then shipped off to China to kill the most people. The Zaibatsus that made these supplies fight a very different war than us. A war where the generals do not wear uniforms and medals, but suits and ties. A war where the greatest victories are not won on the battlefield, but in the markets. A war where the goal is not to capture the most territory, but rather, the most profit."

Once in the west, they disembarked again, somewhat slower and less orderly than the first time. The Japanese soldiers marched past their Chinese counterparts. Dirty uniforms, muddy guns, and disorganized regiments stood in stark contrast towards those of their imperial masters. \"We're here because you need us!\" every footstep smugly declared. It surprised no one when a large brawl broke out between the two camps. Chinese fists and Japanese boots met in the late evening sunset.

The Yuan knows it. Most of all, Presiden Gao Zongwu knows it. He knows that China is not ready for the future. If they cannot defeat their fellow Chinese, what hope do they have of defeating the Japanese?\n\nStone-faced, he begins drafting a letter of gratitude. \"To our asian brothers,\" it begins, as too many others did. He then extolls the bravery of Japanese soldiers and the generosity of the emperor. He thanks the Japanese for their commitment towards the protection of China. Finally, he humbly requests that the Republic of China be given joint oversight of the Xinan territory in the spirit of Pan-Asiansim, ending the letter.

I doubt they have a good postal service down there."\n\n"Whatever you say, Mr. President." The President's aide left the room, shutting the door behind him.\n\nGao was left in his room alone. The threat of the mad dog was real, but all men can be reasoned with, the president had learned this much working in the foreign service. Maybe he ought to write a follow up in the meantime? Yes.

The last light from the outskirts of Kunming had gone out hours ago, no soul could be seen roaming around the dense jungle. The light was no issue however, the rats scurrying around the dormant village possessed no soul at all, or at least that's what shaken officers reported back to high command. The Y-Force, renowned for their performance in the Second Sino-Japanese War, had taken up arms once again at the behest of an increasingly desperate President Zongwu. Their orders were unambiguous, strike fear into the heart of Long Yun and his bandits. The trap had been laid, Long Yun's nightly patrol would make their rounds in the unsuspecting village. It would be there the expeditionary force would pounce and put this dog down for good.\n\nAs the hours passed, a pale white spectator peaked behind the clouds, eagerly awaiting the battle for control of Yunnan. From afar, a faint sound of a vehicle crept up, kilometers away, meters away, and then the blast.\n\nThe sorry state of the Chinese army became evident on that night where the Y-Force held all the cards. Upon hearing the explosion, chaos reigned. Undertrained recruits sprang out in pitiful attempts at glory while others quizzically looked around, unsure if it was time to strike or not. Long Yun and his caravan of disciplined soldiers patrolled for this reason and were more than ready for whatever the ragtag group of mercenaries had planned for. The slaughter ended as quickly as it began, Long Yun gave no quarter to his enemies. The last chance at stamping out the scourge of Yunnan ended with the Chinese soldiers scattering. The following morning, bureaucrats were horrified to find the decaying carcass of the Y-Force commander on the steps of the Yuan. The body's chest had been torn open and hollowed out, only a small note remained. 'His soul has been given back to China.'"

Qiao shifted his weight as his eyes scanned the room, Long Yun isn't stupid and he pledged to be punctual. Something was amiss. The weight of the situation started to set in, the occupants of the warehouse did little to keep him company. Boxes filled to the brim with Yen sat to his back and his rusty pistol hung on his waist. Trying to calm his nerves, he picked up the pistol and began to toss it between his hands. He began to relax and hum a tune as he waited, and waited, and waited. He slouched up against the wall, his eyelids becoming heavy. Before he fully dozed off, the door flung open with a thud. Qiao sprung to life, stammering to explain his poor first impression. His explanation was not responded with reprimand but with bullets. Qiao never saw the barrage of fire explode from the doorway nor the squad of men file in afterward to confiscate the hundreds of thousands of Yen.\n\nChinese spies in Kunming were pleased to see Long Yun the next day parading down the city proudly displaying the crates of Yen. Things took a turn for the worst when Yun parked in the city square and dropped the boxes from atop his truck. Standing on the roof, the powerful orator spoke before the growing crowd.\n\n"I was contacted by the Japanese puppets in Nanjing within the last week. We have shaken them to their core to their point where they are trying to buy our subservience with scraps of paper! Money is the one and only vile language of the Sphere. Here is what I say to them!" The soldiers broke from standing at attention, poured gasoline on top of the Yen, struck a match and threw it in. The King of Yunnan's loyal subjects cheered and his soldiers saluted as he continued, "China cannot be bought! We can't be tamed like the rest of the suits in Nanjing. The spirit of China cannot be bought and sold like some Japanese commodity! The puppet master will continue to attempt to sway us or to beat us into accepting the death of China but they will never succeed."

Mr. Yun, I offer you one question, have you ever had the fate of millions weigh on your back? Your revolutionary zeal is admirable and certainly welcome in the new China we are building, but Mr. Yun, do you comprehend this is not a fairytale? Take off your rose glasses and look at the world around you. China is not in the same situation it was in your youth, before your tenure in prison, the world has changed and you haven't. We are both revolutionaries, I define myself as a pragmatist, however. We can only pull China out of the past from which you live in with assistance from our Asian brothers. We aren't in a situation to provide for ourselves and no amount of blood will pay for the newest assembly line. I empathize with you Mr. Yun, on occasion I can feel trapped, trapped by paperwork, by the incomprehensible babbling of the Yuan, or by my legacy.

Their might and ferocity is unlike anything seen in China recently, but this is an issue reserved for the Chinese government first. Therefore, Tokyo has reaffirmed their support of the Chinese government in dealing with the anarchy.\n\nThis is not to say, however, Japan will sit and watch from a distance. Shipments of small arms, artillery pieces, and support equipment have been delivered to arm the Nanjing Government's army against Long Yun's revolutionaries, tied to Japanese advisory officers. With official strategy being to support, aid, supply, and advise the Chinese military in this conflict, the Japanese shipments symbolise a unique flair of East-Asian unity in the Japanese-dominated media.\n\nWhilst the Chinese government may be better prepared to counter the rebels, their new toys come with Japanese strings attached, and only time will tell how far this will go until fears of complete domination will be realised.""

Dispatching tomorrow morning, the auxiliaries will support the Chinese government in matters of defence and counter-insurgency. These men will man artillery, support fire teams, provide aerial reconnaissance, and act as strategic advisors to the Chinese officers embroiled in this guerilla war.\n\nMany recognise these Japanese troops as honourable troops helping maintain peace and order in the western reaches of China. An area known for its anarchy and darkness from the light of government, Japanese support in these lands is appreciated and alleviating for the already stressed Chinese military. However, with Japanese boots back in China, many cannot help but be reminded of Tokyo's persistent and pressuring gaze over Nanjing."

The matter had been debated time and time again, mostly with concern over how deeply the Imperial Japanese Army should have involvement in the conflict, only coming to a consensus in the face of the serious threat to the Chinese regime.\n\nThe Prime Minister spoke from his notes of the increasing threat of Long Yun's insurgency; the speed and dexterity that it has overwhelmed Chinese battalions and fortresses, the ravaging and barbarous nature of his armies, and much more. He paused for a moment, looking down upon the human cost of the war, and was silent. He returned his attention to the room, and closed the note, and discussed the political implications of Japanese inaction.\n\nHowever, the potential reaction of the Chinese to the deployment of more troops in China was debated for the first time today. The Prime Minister insisted that this was the most appropriate action to take, and indeed it was far too late to recall these troops, but with a greater Japanese presence in China over matters of security and counter-insurgency, more in Nanjing begin to question the state of Chinese sovereignty under the Japanese wing."

War began to consume China, and the Nanjing government was struggling to cling onto it's lands as they were overrun by the rebels. Now on their last legs, President Gao has turned to the Japanese government for help in crushing this rebellion that posed a threat to the very existence of the Chinese republic.\n\nIn all the chaos of the conflict, it had remained largely a matter reserved for the Chinese government, but now with the violence comparable to a civil war, the Japanese have firmly anchored their attention back into the republic. The return of Japanese military interests into the heart of China had reminded many of the war just 29 years ago, in which fire and death had reduced much of China to ashes, and fear and torment traumatised millions of Chinese into submission.\n\nNeedless to say, the Chinese request for Japanese intervention in this anarchy was the opportunity needed for the world to witness the Empire flex its muscles.

The assembly moved to approve of the Prime Minister's actions; many agreed that the war had escalated in China, and duty had forced Japan's hand in intervention.\n\nAs peers shook hands and clinked their glasses, ships carrying thousands of troops harboured into Chinese harbors not already overrun by the Long Yun's bandits. Eager to engage in the fighting, entire battalions jumped into battle at a time, rushing across the war-scorched landscape to reclaim land from the revolutionaries.\n\nPresident Gao of China did not request nor approve of this measure, but he was in no position to reject such an advancement from his Japanese overlords. As the Imperial Japanese Army waged war across the nation, he could only sit and watch as his forces were overshadowed by their might and brutality. Although the Japanese proved to be initially successful, President Gao's cynicism doubted the long-term successes of the Japanese against such ruthless guerilla fighters.

The workers were loud, but the rain smacking against the concrete surfaces of the port was louder. Thunder roared in the distance, but this did not concern the workers as they continued to shift the equipment from the decks onto military shipment vehicles. A group of Japanese officials left the ship and met with the manager of one of the dockyard teams, handing him papers to be signed as proof of delivery. He signed, intimidated by the men dressed in dark plastic coverings, and wiped the raindrops from his hair off of the clipboard before returning it.\n\nMany of the dockyard workers threw the boxes off of the deck, ignoring the hiragana warnings, either out of hatred for the japanese or not being able to read the text, but the team manager turned a blind eye. The Japanese men stood in a shelter beside a brick building not too far from the dark ports and smoked cigarettes, unconcerned with the ship and the cargo's treatment.

They left the camp and began walking through the wet mud and slippery paved roads towards the town.\n\nThey had walked into the town in the evening hours, when the warm air trapped under dense vegetation had heated the rainwater and made everyone sweat. The locals stood outside their homes, all staring at the soldiers marching through the small village streets. Some ushered their crying children back into their homes, whilst others leant on door frames, watching their every move. The soldiers approached an old man sat on a stool sheltered from the rains, and the translator began to greet and introduce themselves. The old man seemed disinterested, whilst the Japanese troops remained in the street, sniggering and pointing at some of the locals.The thunder crashed louder, and the rains grew more intense.\n\nThe group of soldiers spent more time in the village, knocking on each door to ask for directions, supplies, or even an offer to trade. Each time, they were turned away once the Japanese auxiliaries were spotted. With the entire village unwilling to cooperate, the translator made a note of the settlement on the map, before turning to instruct the group to return to base.

Police stood behind wooden barriers in the city, armed as if they were there to hold back riots of people. Crowds had gathered to see the march of the Imperial Japanese Army through the city, followed by a marching band playing tunes from the war twenty-nine years before. Groups of schoolgirls were gathered at awkwardly regular intersections of Nanjing's streets, holding petals in their cupped hands, and looked fearful of the young Japanese men marching through the city. They threw the petals in the air in a beautiful scene, but it quickly became noticeable they had to be reminded by teachers to do so on time.\n\nIn the first row of the IJA march, one of the young soldiers broke his gaze ahead of him and looked at the crowds for a moment. They did not match the enthusiastic descriptions he had been educated in school about, nor did they seem as welcoming or seductive as his comrades had joked over. Rather, he was intimidated slightly by their hostile silence and distressing gaze. He noticed the crowds were gathered in great numbers, filling street corners and public squares, but many of their hearts were empty of love for the Japanese.\n\nLess than thirty minutes into the parade, the streets began to clear, street markets returned to business, and the people began to distract themselves from the return of the Japanese.

The spectacle we forged caught the attention of the Japanese agents, but left us with unintended consequences. The feeble state of Chinese intelligence was exposed as it took no more than a few shakedowns and interrogations for the curtain to be drawn and our interference to be exposed.\n\nIn a rather stern letter from Tokyo, chastising us for sabotaging the efforts of Pan-Asian brotherhood, the Japanese have made it clear that this will not go unpunished.

Due to Japan's tumultuous situation as guardian of Asia, they have their hands full dealing with supervisor, insurrections, and civil-strife. For once, Japan does not come with demands, but a request, a hand outstretched waiting to be gripped by the people of China. While assisting Japan in their efforts to track down the elusive Dai Li and the Juntong leaves us with much to gain, how often has Japan appreciated our assistance? What is to stop Japan from returning to the policies of the status quo after this terrorist group is crushed? After all, the cost of our own people, letting this conspiracy reach a boiling point may force Japan to retreat back to their home islands due to overwhelming resistance."

Already, sides are being picked and inside our own clique many staff members are wondering if we will declare support for a side. Doing so could mean a grand share of the spoils if we were to back the winning fighter, but a risk of losing is certainly present. Those in our sphere of influence are very predominantly favourable towards the Chinese government and not aligning with them could mean a severe lack of war support should we align with Japan. Of course, we could always just stay neutral in the conflict and not take the gambit."

We will join the war to uphold the stability of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, a risk of losing is always a scary thought, but surely Tokyo will not fail us, right? Due to our heavy links to the Japanese government, we must enter the conflict on their side.

###Polio Crisis
CHI_Unrest_West:0 "서부의 소요"
CHI_Unrest_West_desc:0 "The rumors arrived almost the same time as the reports did. A rebellion, a plague, a wild fire, a curse? All that is clear to us is that the western rural regions have seeming out of nowhere been thrown into turmoil. The official reports have hardly cleared up the situation, as they are vague to the point of negligence. The states control of the west has always been questionable at best, now it seems more thoroughly at the periphery."
CHI_Establish_Situation:0 "상황 설정"
CHI_Establish_Situation_desc:0 "We cannot gain back control until we understand who, or what our foe is. Regular reports have proven themselves entirely inadequate and as such we should send out a delegation to fully grasp the situation, with a small contingent of soldiers just in case. The public will in the meantime have to content themselves with the Public Health Department "doing all in our power to combat disturbances in the west."
CHI_Find_Who:0 "용의자 탐색"
CHI_Find_Who_desc:0 "It was clear from the beginning that this disturbance has affected people of all classes and positions, what is disturbingly unclear is how the situation was allowed to deteriorate to this point.

CHI_Find_Why:0 "원인 탐색"
CHI_Find_Why_desc:0 "The people and the state of China have the same question on their lips: why is the west in turmoil? While the streets have only given rumors and wild stories of evil curses or cruel Japanese experiments gone wrong it is the state's duty to provide the people with the truth. Hopefully the Nanjing delegation can inform us all about just what is going on over there."
CHI_Find_Where:0 "원천지 탐색"

CHI_The_Culprit:0 "범인"
CHI_The_Culprit_desc:0 "We have clarified much of the situation, and are now sure that some kind of disease is spreading across western China.

We have our crime: now we need the culprit."
CHI_Polio:0 "소아마비?"
CHI_Polio_desc:0 "Samples of water, food, human tissue and more have been sent to the labs already, but many in our medical profession already suspect a culprit: polio.

CHI_Cure_desc:0 "We have our killer: polio has begun to infest our western provinces in epidemic proportions. Not much is known of the disease within our own fledgling medical community, but all are united in the desire to find a cure and defeat this menace. The only question is how."
CHI_Alternate_Approach:0 "대체접근법"
CHI_Alternate_Approach_desc:0 "Three proposals for finding a cure have come forward. Among the pan asianists there is a strong desire to seek help from Japan, indeed several Japanese experts have already volunteered to aid the people of west China. Others wish to build up our own capacity, and to deal with this problem on our own ability through expanding our research. Then the third: a Peking research group claims that by bringing together the best and brightest of China we can find a cure in no time!"
CHI_Virology:0 "바이러스학 연구"
CHI_Virology_desc:0 "While we may not yet know how to stop polio, our medical professionals do know that the poliovirus is the agent of our misery.

CHI_Understand_Spread:0 "확산에대한 이해"
CHI_Understand_Spread_desc:0 "The first thing to do when confronted by an epidemic is to stop the spreading of the disease. At some level popular knowledge and fear of the situation has already done this. Travel to the western provinces has dropped off and various peasant paranoid responses have complicated the situation. It is time to bring some reason and professionalism to containment."
CHI_Build_Labs:0 "연구시설 확대"
CHI_Build_Labs_desc:0 "We know already what we need to do: to produce a vaccine like they have in America, and distribute it among our people.

CHI_Fund_Research:0 "연구자금 지원"
CHI_Fund_Research_desc:0 "Just as a soldier is worthless without adequate arms, even the brightest scientist is lost without necessary equipment and funding.

CHI_Ask_Universities:0 "대학에 문의"
CHI_Ask_Universities_desc:0 "While the pan Asian effort has no doubt been wonderful for finding a solution to this epidemic we should not sell our own young talent short.

CHI_Crack_Team:0 "최고의 전문가 팀"
CHI_Crack_Team_desc:0 "Rather than spread our resources without direction, or debase ourselves for the Japanese, we should instead focus on bringing the best of China together to find a cure.

CHI_Man_Beijing:0 "베이징에서 온 사람"
CHI_Man_Beijing_desc:0 "Gu Fangzhou has been contacted, and informed of his new task. While it may take some time for his group to be fully realized the work already shows promise.

CHI_Beida:0 "베이다 그룹"
CHI_Beida_desc:0 "Largely drawn from Peking University, colloquially known as Beida, Gu has drawn to himself his closest and brightest associates and through them great things are happening.

CHI_Mass_Cure:0 "대중을 위한치료?"
CHI_Mass_Cure_desc:0 "Our government's attention has been almost exclusively on limiting the spread and combating the effects of the current Polio outbreak. Gu has recently begun looking into the logistics of a far more ambitious program than simply this outbreak. As has been done in America Gu suggests that all of China's children be given the vaccine to develop a herd immunity."
CHI_Produce_Vaccine:0 "백신 생산"
CHI_Produce_Vaccine_desc:0 "The time has come. After months of research and emergency measures our scientists finally feel they can move forward with producing a vaccine. The laboratories are stocked, the records compiled and thousands more Chinese children lay dead since we started. It is time to act, all we need to do is give the final go ahead."
CHI_Prototype:0 "프로토타입"
CHI_Prototype_desc:0 "Our network of research stations and experimental efforts have been tasked with developing a prototype. China has little experience with such vaccinations and none are sure how long it will take to develop a working prototype, or even if that prototype will do more good than harm. However we are at last starting to produce tangible results, and can show our sceptics more than paper."
CHI_Vaccine_Logistics:0 "접종 실행계획"
CHI_Vaccine_Logistics_desc:0 "Our prototype has been finalized: now we move onto field testing. A slight issue has propped up however. In the rush to develop the vaccine no one has considered how to actually administer it to the rural population without spoiling. Ill trained agents overwhelmed with crowds have put a hiccup in our plans, but it is nothing we cannot work through."
CHI_Less_Favorable:0 "기대에 못미치다"
CHI_Less_Favorable_desc:0 "Our hopeful first round of vaccinations has sadly not lived up to expectations. While many were given the prototype the Polio epidemic itself has continued, and the effects of the vaccine are less than what we had desired. It may have been to much to hope for our first attempt to succeed, and now we must learn from our mistakes."
CHI_Different_Approach:0 "다른 접근법"
CHI_Different_Approach_desc:0 "We have learned from our first attempts at vaccination, and will not repeat them. Through clinical testing and following up on those who took the prototype vaccine we will find where we went wrong, correct ourselves, and hopefully win back the trust of those who have already been failed by us once.

CHI_The_Oil_Crisis_desc:0 "As China has risen once more to its rightful place of respect before the other powers in the world, its challenges have likewise risen in danger and scale. This is only natural. Strength invites envy, envy invites enemies, and those enemies shall stop at nothing to bring the middle kingdom back to its knees.\n\nThis time, the challenge is the same one faced by many other nations of the world: what is rapidly becoming known as the "Oil Crisis", as the destructive violence tearing through the Middle East upends the global supply of precious black gold. This international emergency is especially detrimental for China, thanks to our newly constructed and resource-thirsty factories and infrastructure.\n\nAlready, the vultures circle to take advantage of our momentary weakness. It is only by steadfastness and ingenuity that we can rise to the challenge, as we have many times before, and exit this crisis stronger than we entered it."
CHI_Inland_Exploration_desc:0 "If the Middle East will not offer us her bounty, we shall have to unearth some treasures of our own. China is a large country, and blessings of geography very often come with blessings of resources. Oil and gas exploration was hardly a priority for us in the past, but now, it must suddenly become one. Using our accumulating technological prowess, we shall assemble Asia's best geologists and surveyors to scour the inland of China, in search of new potential deposits of oil to develop and exploit."
CHI_Limit_Oil_Usage_desc:0 "The most obvious and immediately necessary response to a lack of oil is to use less oil. Sadly, this is anything but harmless to execute. Our nascent industrial base is dependent on a steady supply of petroleum, and we cannot afford to abandon industrialization and its role in the formation of a new, modernized China.\n\nWe will have to pick and choose which critical industries receive how much of what they need from our steadily dwindling supply, and none of our options are good ones. It will be a politically costly burden to bear, weakening our support among the people, and especially among those industrialists left with the short end of the stick. Sadly, it does not look as though we will be able to consider ending the rationing until the crisis is thoroughly resolved, and China's hunger for oil is finally quenched."
CHI_Search_for_New_Oilfields_desc:0 "The time has come to take the first real step in addressing the Oil Crisis. Our rushed efforts at unearthing new oil deposits have met with modest success, sufficient enough to begin construction of the first experimental wells in the inland provinces. The future success of the five modernizations, and perhaps the future strength and vitality of our very country, might well rest on the godly providence that the gentle hills of our backyard just happen to hold these resources we need most."
CHI_Price_Controls_desc:0 "We need to make the most effective use of all of the oil we can get our hands on, and that means controlling the domestic market: both in production, and in consumption. We should discourage any consumption of this most precious commodity that is not economically necessary, and the best way to discourage consumption is to make a product ludicrously expensive.\n\nIndustry will be able to bear the cost to keep itself running: the populace will not. A small price to pay, in the long-term. What is the inability for the urban workers to drive themselves around for awhile, compared to the economic strength of our country?"
CHI_Petroleum_in_Henan_desc:0 "Why shouldn't the birthplace of our proud and ancient civilization also be the birthplace of the solution to the energy crisis? Perhaps the Xia and Shang of millenia past took Henan for their home for a reason—a divine, prophetic act, informing our present generation of the wealth hidden in these central plains of China.\n\nOr, perhaps it's a coincidence. Either way, we shall extract every last drop of crude we can from the banks of the Yellow River. However much (or however little) we are able to gather, this oldest province of China shall play its part in ushering in the newest and proudest age for the Middle Kingdom."
CHI_The_Anhui_Fields_desc:0 "A few scattered deposits have been noticed by our team of surveyors in Anhui, and it's incumbent upon us to exploit them with expedience. Sadly, it is hardly looking as though we have anything comparable to the great oil fields of Arabia with which to sustain our economic development. Making do with what we have is better than nothing, but is still not adequate. This will not be the end of the crisis."
CHI_Better_Extraction_Methods_desc:0 "We do not have the same abundance of oil as some other countries might, so we must make the best use of what little we do have locked away beneath the earth. Efficiency must do her part in defeating scarcity. Our engineers will be set to the task of finding out new and better ways to extract oil and natural gas from beneath the ground. "
CHI_Odd_Even_Policy_desc:0 "Given the depth of the supply glut of oil we have on our laps, it is necessary for us to take some creative and unorthodox approaches to rationing. To make sure our conservation of oil for civilian light industry is both thorough and fair, we shall restrict purchase of gasoline to 50% of the population per day. Vehicles with license plates ending in even numbers shall be permitted to purchase gasoline on even days of the month, and vehicles with odd numbered license plates on odd days.\n\nHopefully, these measures will have the effect of both restricting consumption overall, as well as cutting back on wasteful practices like panic buying and daily trips to the pump for small top-ups. The burden of this crisis shall be shared as equitably as is reasonable."
CHI_Oil_For_the_Industries_desc:0 "Some activities requiring oil consumption are simply more important than others. Civilian ease of travel is a practically useless luxury, whereas keeping factories running and transportation of bulk goods is the lifeblood of the modern economy. It is only sane, and reasonable, for us to give heavy preference to heavy industry for the duration of the Oil Crisis."
CHI_We_Need_More_Oil_desc:0 "There is still simply not enough oil to go around to keep the factories churning and the trucks rolling. The measures we've taken so far have not exactly been useless, but they also haven't been nearly enough to end the emergency we find ourselves in. This crisis needs to be resolved, and soon.\n\nIf we truly want to make our great country of China energy self-sufficient, we will need to do more as a nation than merely drill a few wells. Forceful and vigorous investments must be made into both production, and the technology for even more future production. All of the best minds of the country must be put together, or else all our efforts at modernization will be for nought. If we fail, we may well risk China's thirst for oil spiraling into outright dehydration."
CHI_Offshore_Exploration_desc:0 "If the land does not have the riches we require to make our necessary improvements as a country, then we shall look to the sea. China is blessed with a long coastline, neighbouring both the Yellow as well as the East and South China seas. There are all sorts of opportunities for offshore oil deposits to be found here, but there are also problems to solve if we mean to ever harvest them. The first step will be easiest: before proceeding, we must establish that these deposits might indeed exist in the first place, or else later efforts will be for nought."
CHI_Convince_Japan_oilcrisis_desc:0 "The biggest problem facing Chinese offshore oil drilling is not the technological hurdles that must be overcome, but the political ones. Our present military and economic arrangements with Tokyo make the prospect of building offshore drilling platforms and coastal refineries... awkward, at best. The Japanese may well object entirely to our efforts in this theatre, and it would not be wise of us to press our case too hard on any issue that our cousins across the sea might come down forcefully against.\n\nThus, it shall be incumbent upon us to convince the Japanese of two things. First, that our ambitions are of no military threat to them. And second, that in fact they are of enormous economic benefit to us both. The Japanese surely thirst for oil just as hungrily as do we, and any deposits we find offshore could be fairly shared with our partners in Nippon—at least for now. It is an uncomfortable prospect that once again find ourselves supplicants, but it is necessary to compromise now, that we may one day in the future never need to again."
CHI_We_Have_The_Technology_desc:0 "A political crisis in the Middle East is what created this problem for us. What will ultimately solve it will be Chinese industrial and technological know-how; the know-how we already acquired for ourselves through our tireless efforts at modernization. The surmounting of this global obstacle by our government will prove to the world that the Chinese republic is in good company among the most developed and technologically advanced nations of the world, capable of finding and extracting resources that even some Western nations might find elusive. China will no longer be seen as a rural backwater: our efforts here will make sure of it."
CHI_We_Need_More_Than_You_desc:0 "It appears the Japanese are hesitant to accept our plans for oil development in the East China Sea. Needless to say, this is problematic for us, as our beloved and trustworthy allies still maintain naval dominance over each of China's coasts. Their envoys insistently argue that the Republic of China already receives nearly as much oil to meets its demands as do the Home Islands, and are skeptical of our plans to produce even more.\n\nBut, that's just the problem: we are bigger than Japan is, and we need more than they do. Obviously, the prospect of our growing industrial might requiring even more oil than Japanese industry could cause some anxiety within certain circles in Tokyo. We'll have to find a good way to spin it, so we can approach the subject with some diplomatic tact--maybe something about our factories still being 'inefficient'. Whatever our friends in the sunrise kingdom need to hear."
CHI_Ask_for_Permission_desc:0 "The time has come to end the backchannels and formally make a request to Tokyo to begin oil development in the East China Sea. The perfect site has already been explored, near to our facilities in Shanghai, and the equipment for the operation already prepared. All we can do now is wait, and hope that the Japanese give us the go ahead to end this crisis."
CHI_Shanghai_Coastal_Fields_desc:0 "Time to move! Construction is finally underway on offshore drilling platforms to harness the vast, untapped energy potential of the sea. The sites' strategic locations near to Shanghai will both make the construction process easier and allow closer access to refineries in our great industrial city of Shanghai.\n\nThe deposits available in the offshore fields are immense, even greater than the imports we used to receive from the Middle East. Our new platforms there will not only help to conclusively end the Oil Crisis, but also facilitate our continued industrial might well into the future. At long last, China's great thirst is on the way to its end."
CHI_Expand_the_Refineries_desc:0 "More crude requires more refineries to turn it into usable products. Our old refining capacity is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of the new China, and so we must have new refineries as well. We will concentrate on constructing these modern petrochemical sites in locations convenient both to manufacturing and to the oil sector, to help meet the demands of both, and to grow the sprawling new industrial centres of the modern China."
CHI_Improve_Shengli_Production_desc:0 "The Shengli is one of the largest and most industrially important oil deposits in China. Dominating domestic production from the province of Shangdong, the Shengli was first taken advantage of long before the Oil Crisis hit, having initially been developed by enterprising Japanese zaibatsus in the 50's. Though its bounty was originally mostly for export to China, consumption patterns have changed since then, and China itself now has greater need of this precious resource--a need that the Japanese companies dominant throughout the Shengli fields are thankfully happy to profit off of filling.\n\nAs consumption has changed, though, so too have production methods. Development in the Shengli took place before some of our current innovations existed, and we can go back and refit some of the wells there to allow for both faster and deeper drilling. It's incumbent on us to focus on making the very best use of every production facility we have, including those owned and operated by Japan."
CHI_The_Worst_Has_Passed_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis that once seemed poised to end China's modernization is now only an inconvenience. Our investments are bearing fruit, and the factories and roadways of China are churning and speeding along again (mostly). Prices are still higher than they need to be, but we have gone far enough as a country that the end is finally on the horizon."
CHI_End_Rationing_desc:0 "No longer will we have to pick and choose which factories receive the resources they need to function. No longer will Chinese drivers be arbitrarily restricted from purchasing on certain days, or forced to only fill up a quarter of their tank. Our efforts have worked, and the availability of oil in China is great enough to make unnecessary any more rations or restrictions. The oil market is back open in China: rationing is finally over!"
CHI_Crisis_Resolved_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis is officially over in China. Through ingenuity and force of will, we have managed to overcome the international energy emergency that shook the whole world to its core, and have come out of it stronger, better, and more self-reliant. Our industry and infrastructure have returned to full production and full capacity, and we are more ready than ever to fulfill our modernizations and make China strong and proud again."
CHI_Synthetic_Dawn_desc:0 "Just as it was the Chinese people themselves that facilitated the country's national liberation from the imperialists of the past, it will be Chinese technology itself that facilitates our national liberation from the resource crises of the present. Our advances towards modernization can help us see the light at the end of the tunnel in the Oil Crisis, and allow us to fix this problem without simply finding more oil deposits to exploit. Instead, we shall make our own oil!\n\nOur reliance on foreign petroleum, and on conventional petroleum deposits in the first place, must come to an end. It is time for a new dawn in the Chinese energy industry: the dawn of synthetics. The future of China will be a future of massive refineries, using modern technology and scientific expertise to turn the resources our nation does possess in abundance into those very resources we demand the most. It shall be an undertaking of immense mechanical scale, and one which will transform China forever more as we enter into the new age."
CHI_Find_the_Experts_desc:0 "The hellfire pace of modernization we have endured these past years have greatly bolstered the scientific community of our country. New capital and new facilities for technological advancement have sprung up all over the land, in various economic sectors, and it shall take the labour of the best of them all to solve the Oil Crisis. We shall focus as a nation on assembling the best and brightest of all of China into a crack emergency response team, who shall enable us to make great strides forwards in the petrochemical industry and to assemble a plan for how to move forward in our efforts at synthesizing oil en masse."
CHI_What_Method_desc:0 "Our scientists have conceived two proposals for how to advance our petrochemical industry, concerning two related chemical processes: coal liquefaction, and the German conceived Fischer-Tropsch process. Both proposals concern the basic idea of turning abundant Chinese coal deposits into usable oil products, but the processes differ slightly in how the coal is refined and in what products can be most easily produced. We shall have to carefully analyze the report put forward by our scientists and choose the path best suited to our government."
CHI_Start_the_Experiments_desc:0 "Now that we have chosen our path, it's time to travel down it. The first step will be testing the proposal we've selected--seeing if it works on a smaller scale for our purposes, before scaling it up to a nation-wide endeavour. If there are any nasty surprises in store for our plan of mass synthesization of oil, we'll find out about them and thoroughly sort them out before we move on to full implementation."
CHI_Build_Synthetic_Refineries_desc:0 "The plans are made, the experiments are concluded, and now it's time for the largest chemical industry project in Chinese history. Even ignoring the sensitivity of construction something like a synthetic oil refinery, the banal aspects of this phase--building so many buildings of such size, and so much accompanying infrastructure--will be a trial in its own right, especially with our industrial might weakened as it is by the very Oil Crisis we're attempting to resolve. This will be quite the lengthy undertaking."
CHI_Synthetic_Fuel_desc:0 "Finally, the moment of truth is at hand. After so many laborious months of planning, testing and constructing, we can reap the rewards of our heroic determination. The first shipments of synthetically refined oil are on their way to gas stations and factory floors all across China, supplementing the meagre conventional oil our consumers have had to fight over for the whole duration of the crisis. By cleverest ingenuity and millions of tons of coal, we will deliver the Oil Crisis its death blow in China!"
CHI_Marching_On_desc:0 "Now that the Oil Crisis is in the past, we have no time left to dwell on it. We will take the advantages we have gained for ourselves from our response to the crisis and use them to further our goals elsewhere, in strengthening and modernizing our great country. The Chinese people cannot know for sure that they will never face another emergency like this again until their country is fully self-sufficient... and fully independent."

 ##Oil Crisis Events

chi.5500.t:0 "Oil Crisis Shocks China"
chi.5500.desc:0 "The increasing destabilization of the Middle East in recent years has finally boiled over. War has engulfed many of the nations of the Arab world, and--as is to be expected--the Western imperialists circle around the competitors like vultures, making puppets of the Arabs' leaders and abusing the war and strife to enrich themselves and further their own political interests. It is a sick and demented state of affairs, far too similar to the abuse that Europe and America inflicted upon our own nation before the revolution. Yet, it is a war in which we have no material stake, and stand to gain nothing.\n\nWe do stand to lose something, though: access to Arab oil. East Asia is no less dependent on petroleum originating from the Middle East than is the rest of the world, and our republic is no exception. Many of the factories and trucks of the Chinese economy run on Middle Eastern crude, and the loss of this precious commodity is sure to wreak havoc on our fragile, developing economy. We shall have to make severe accommodations in the short term to deal with the initial effects of the Oil Crisis, and lengthier efforts will be required to resolve our dependence on Arab crude entirely."
 chi.5500.a:0 "The imperialists sabotage our economy yet again..."

 chi.5501.t:0 "Go Out Looking or Make Our Own?"
 chi.5501.desc:0 "Even as we've made our best efforts to solve the Oil Crisis plaguing China, a final solution still eludes us. It's time to make an important decision as to how we can deliver this problem the swiftest and most certain end, to restore the national economy to full capacity and reenable China's modernization.\n\nA fork in the road awaits us, and we must make a fateful choice about the future of our country. Shall we solve the Oil Crisis by going out and looking for more oil; pursuing drilling of deposits offshore, beyond the coast? Or shall we solve the crisis through more mechanical means: the synthetic production of oil through liquefaction of our coal reserves?"
 chi.5501.a:0 "Go out looking: we will end the Oil Crisis by investing in offshore drilling." 
 chi.5501.b:0 "Make our own: this crisis will be ended through synthetic oil production." 


 chi.5502.t:0 "The Price Tag"
 chi.5502.desc:0 "Any great undertaking by a government is almost sure to be dearly expensive, but the price tag for our scientists' preferred synthetic oil initiative has a discouragingly high number of zeroes. The Germans' Fischer-Tropsch process is the best available for synthetically refining oil, and our own petrochemical engineers are understandably eager for China to possess a petrochemical industry comparable to that great juggernaut of the world. They are so enthusiastic, even, that their plan to emulate Germany was apparently conceived without any thought as to how prohibitively expensive it would be to actually implement; row after row of new synthetic oil refineries using the most up-to-date, expensive equipment does not come cheap. We will have plenty of oil and of the best quality possible, to be sure, but what good will it be if we can scarcely afford any trucks or tanks to put the oil into after the plan ravages our pocketbook?\n\nIn contrast, the second proposal--a focus on older, direct coal liquefaction techniques--will be a much easier undertaking for our government, requiring only the reoutfiting of existing facilities already used for refining conventional crude. It will (hopefully) still be enough to end the Oil Crisis, but will perhaps leave us with less room to grow going into the future, and fall short of the promise of full energy independence. On the upside, we won't go broke if we pick it."
 chi.5502.a:0 "China will have energy independence, no matter the cost."
 chi.5502.b:0 "This was all meant to end the Oil Crisis, not start a new financial crisis."

 chi.5503.t:0 "The Negotiating Table"
 chi.5503.desc:0 "The sweaty, suited man, dabbed at his forehead. The light of the projector was hardly the brightest thing in the room. The occupants of the boardroom impatiently checked their wrists for the time, he was doing something wrong. Adjusting his tie, he clicked to the next slide, "If you'll turn your attention to this graph down to the bottom left, oh well I guess that'd be your right." The ambient hum of the projector and the nervous laughter of the man hung in the air, "So yes, the bottom right. You'll see that with our current models, the best estimates put the Petroleum and Chemical Corporation of Jiangsu staying afloat for another four to five months." One of the businessmen took a drag from his cigar and spoke up, "We have no plans to bailout your failing companies. Costs are up all over the world, this crisis is not contained to just our economic bloc."\n\n"We are very much well aware of this, the oil situation has not developed to our advantage whatsoever, no doubt about it. But it is in these times of trouble we come to our allies, our brothers!" The frankly disinterested room remained silent, staring at the man. "Right?""
 chi.5503.a:0 "Surely our bond is stronger than stocks?"

 chi.5504.t:0 "Pen to Paper."
 chi.5504.desc:0 "Eyebrows raised, the businessmen spoke their own language of glances and half smiles. Before them stood a tall order, the collapse of economies in the playground of Japanese businessmen was sure to harm their interests. The man, despite his lack of charisma, made a solid point. Not that patriotic fervor of pan-asian unity, the man was correct in that the nations of the Sphere are brothers. Tokyo stands as the big brother, guiding his siblings. This had been the intention from the start, whether he knew it or not, the man had said just what the businessmen wanted to hear. The fate of China was in the hands of the Japanese empire, in the hands of her stock exchange rather.\n\n"Well Mr. Zhelan, you make a compelling argument." Nearly dropping the pen he nervously played with, the man stood stunned. "Of course we will assist our Asian brothers!" The businessman threw out his arms. "Now obviously, such a massive undertaking doesn't come without price, such is only fair, no? A mutual agreement between our two nations." The man was grinning from ear to ear, "Your decision here will alleviate the worst effects from hitting, speaking on behalf of the average Chinese citizen, I thank you."\n\n"Of course, we only have their best interests at heart. Such is why we'll be assuming control over the petroleum industry for the time being." The man's grin began to fade, "E-excuse me?" The businessman nodded and continued, "Oh yes of course, I am sure you're aware our expertise is simply invaluable. We can streamline the process with direct control." "But-" "And then of course we'll be in communication with our associates across the Sphere to keep oil flowing. How does that sound?" "Well-" "Great!""
 chi.5504.a:0 "Just sign along the dotted line"

 chi.5505.t:0 "No Dice."
 chi.5505.desc:0 "Without a word, five of the eight corporate representatives gathered their things and strode out of the room. The man's face became beet red, this conference was rapidly decaying. "Gentlemen!' The man quickly walked to the door to block any other occupants from leaving. "Let's not jump to a decision already! There is still much to be said about this! For instance, I have been permitted to make concessions! Hear that? We can work something out!"\n\n"There is nothing for you to offer us at this stage in the game." retorted one of the few remaining businessmen, "You would be lucky to find a beggar willing to hitch their cart to your dying industry. Excuse me." The man gathered his papers into a manila envelope, pushed in his chair, and pushed his way past the desperate man guarding the door. Then there were two. Sweat dripped down the man's forehead, "What do you want? What can we offer you? Name your price!"\n\n"The only thing you could offer us is Saudi oil. Good Day and goodluck." That was it. The next few minutes were a blur for the man, his eyes stung as he slid down the wall. Sitting down in the empty boardroom, his only company being the soft hum of the projector, the man whipped his eyes and rested his head against the wall. "We are so fucked.""
 chi.5505.a:0 "Backstabbed by our own allies!"

 ###Western Insurrection Crisis Tree###

 CHI_State_Of_Emergency:0 "비상사태 선언"
 CHI_State_Of_Emergency_desc:0 "While the western reaches of our authority have never been peaceful and minor rebellions are all but expected no one in China remembers a war quite like this. Long Yun, a half forgotten ghost of the second world war, has madly set both himself and the entire south west against our government. While Long's chances against the might of china are zero the border forces have non the less come under harsh attack and an exodus of thousands fleeing the new front now floods into the cities. The nation is in crisis, but we shall not be overcome! The state has issued a declaration of emergency measures to see us put down this mad dog!"
 CHI_Evacuation:0 "피난민캠프 조성"
 CHI_Evacuation_desc:0 "Shopkeeps, prisoners, farmers, professionals, government employees: all blend into one great mass of refugees fleeing the western front and Long Yun's madness. Often carrying all they now own on their back, including their children, the new destitute will seek cities and form camps as refuge and we know only to well what this press of the desperate brings in their wake: Desease, violence, hunger, gangs controlling the streets and the state's authority destroyed by a thousand unfed mouths. Not to mention the fact that these civilians are crowding the very same roads which our own troops must use to fight the new enemy. Clearly something must be done about the human crises as well as the political and military. And the first step is to officially decree an evacuation of newly dangerous land."
 CHI_Temporary_Camps_For_The_Displaced:0 "Temporary Camps for the Displaced"
 CHI_Temporary_Camps_For_The_Displaced_desc:0 "Many find themselves sleeping under the open sky, lashed by cold rain in the night and forced ever onward during the day as the people pick the land clean in their desperation. The bodies of the very young and very old can be found already both in the makeshift camps and along the road. Adding the discipline and authority of the state is the best way to create some stability in the exodus and keep some kind of record of how many people there are, and spar our small cities the burden of finding their population doubled by strangers overnight. The order for the construction of camps by the state and the dissolving of the squatters has been given, and is presently being carried out."
 CHI_Food_Security:0 "식량안보"
 CHI_Food_Security_desc:0 "Now that many of the displaced have been corralled into our camps a rational system of providing for these people can be pursued. Those leeches preying on the desperate: gouging prices for food and water far above what they are really worth shall be pushed out and we shall provide at a reasonable price. Diverting shipments which may be made to less afflicted parts of the nation shall allow these poor people to have the first good meal they have had in weeks while also enforcing our authority in the chaos of the west. The people shall be grateful to us for this as well as the generals heroic efforts against the mad Long Yun."
 CHI_Security_On_The_Road:0 "도로안전확보"
 CHI_Security_On_The_Road_desc:0 "While our troops may be able to simply shove the people out of their way and onto the battlefield the mad rush from Long's dogs has left many with little food to eat and many unfamiliar roads to walk. The least that our state can do for these people is show that we have not forgotten them by distributing what food we can spare and increasing police presence on the road to dissuade the criminal inclinations of the people. Providing some measure of security and a trusted third party to mediate disputes will make this whole ordeal less painful for the masses and hopefully gain popular acclaim for ourselves as well. Having decided to send such aid to the people all that remains is to deal with the details."
 CHI_Moving_Wealth:0 "부의 이동"
 CHI_Moving_Wealth_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that in the people's haste to flee danger many a factory and stockpile has been left unattended, and more importantly, left intact. Wherever the traitors advance they lay hold of the bounty of loyal Chinese labor, and Japanese property. This only strengthens the enemy and infuriates our greatest ally, and leave thousands of chinese without prospects of normalcy even after victory. To address this crisis management has expanded its mission to include the movement of all valuable assets away from the front and closer to the coast along with the men and women across Asia who owned them."
 CHI_Crisis_Management:0 "위기관리"
 CHI_Crisis_Management_desc:0 "What was once desperation and scarcely contained panic has become a new kind of normal. The people will look to the government for instruction, and those who do not will not go unpunished. Food and other basic goods are brought to the camps and a kind of predictability has returned to western chinese life. Our expertise in handling such crises has been incalculably increased, albeit at a high price. For the first time however we can now breath sure of our peoples safety and order, and even begin looking to the future rather than just todays fresh crises. It is hardly a permanent solution, far from it, but for today we can congratulate ourselves: mission accomplished."

 CHI_Blooding_The_Army:0 "첫 실전"
 CHI_Blooding_The_Army_desc:0 "This insurrection will be the first major combat opportunity for many of the men in our ranks - and the first in decades for all of the rest. The Chinese Government has never faced a challenge like this before, and it is up to us to ensure that our track record begins with a victory. Perhaps the hanjian Long Yun will be of some service to China after all: it will be his rebellion that makes our nation ready for war again, and shows the world that China's strength is not to be ignored."
 CHI_Minimize_Casualties:0 "사상자의 최소화"
 CHI_Minimize_Casualties_desc:0 "It would not do for us to play into the rebels' hands by simply sending wave after wave of men to die in the hills of Yunnan, target practice for the enemy to perfect their aim. Our advances must be concentrated, deliberate, and measured, or else we are as good as prey for the mad dog to feast upon. The wealth of manpower of our state does not mean that the losses we take will not be dearly felt by the men on the ground; if the soldier does not believe his commander cares about his life, then the soldier will not care to heed his commander's word."
 CHI_Retreat_Does_Not_Mean_Run_Away:0 ""후퇴"라는 것은 "도망"이라는 것과는 다르다"
 CHI_Retreat_Does_Not_Mean_Run_Away_desc:0 "Our army is not as well disciplined as we had hoped. The paper strength of our divisions is not bearing fruit on the battlefield, due in no small part to a crisis of confidence in our men on the ground. Far from marching into Kunming on the piled bodies of rebels, our army has mostly been pushed back, surrendering yet more Chinese ground to the King of Yunnan.\n\nBut it gets worse. The men do not even give us the courtesy of remaining together as they are beaten. So disorganized are they in their flight that they cede not only territory but oftentimes the integrity of their division to the enemy. We must teach our soldiers that 'retreat' absolutely does NOT mean 'run away', and that losing the battle for one village need not mean losing the war for China."
 CHI_Stop_Running:0 "도망치지마라 이새끼들아"
 CHI_Stop_Running_desc:0 "We have had enough. Nevermind just undisciplined, this shoddy excuse for an army is an embarrassment to the country it is dying for, and we cannot stand for it! It is time to end the humiliating losses that the National Army is being handed in the hills. If our soldiers will not keep fighting out of bravery, then they will keep fighting out of fear. Not one step back unprompted. The word is going out: any soldier that breaks his formation to flee from the sight of battle will be shot. Our losses may mount and our men may be discontent, but let them die fighting rather than live fleeing. Our country is at stake here, and all that we will be losing are this generation's cowards. The China of tomorrow will be a China of men who stood and fought!"
 CHI_Move_On_Our_Orders:0 "명령을 따라야할것이다"
 CHI_Move_On_Our_Orders_desc:0 "The companies in the field are not acting on our direction. Their leaders make decisions on a whim, advancing or falling back as it suits them and wasting men and equipment on haphazard offensives that only weaken their fighting condition for the enemy's attack the next day. Our army must move on our orders and only our orders. Perhaps the lieutenants can be permitted personal initiative at a later date, when they have demonstrated the barest of competence-if they even live to do so."
 CHI_Insubordination_Will_Not_Be_Tolerated:0 "불복종은 용납되지 않는다"
 CHI_Insubordination_Will_Not_Be_Tolerated_desc:0 "Our government is the one true government of China. Anyone who would work against our government is therefore a traitor to China. This includes the rebels in Yunnan, but it also includes the rebels in our own army. Any of those who would hear the words of their commanders and ignore or disobey them are just as much rebels as the servants of Long Yun. When we say charge, the men should charge. When we say regroup, the men should regroup. When we say retreat, the men should retreat. We have learned from our mistakes; insubordination will no longer be tolerated as a battlefield reality. Instead, those who engage in it will be treated as battlefield casualties. We will make our army wholly obedient, by excising anyone who is not wholly loyal."
 CHI_Restoring_Discipline:0 "규율의 복원"
 CHI_Restoring_Discipline_desc:0 "The cowards have all either run off or died, and the National Army of China is finally becoming an instrument worthy of the ones it serves. Our soldiers are finally coming to respect authority, obey their orders, and adhere as strictly to their codes of conduct as we have liked them to from the start. The group of men with guns fighting for our regime can now, finally, be honestly called an 'army'."

 CHI_Rotate_Officers:0 "장교 교체"
 CHI_Rotate_Officers_desc:0 "If we are to make the most of this rebellion as an opportunity for self-strengthening then all of our officer corps must share in the glory of the reconquest of Yunnan. By the time the southwest is cleansed of this insurrection, there shall not be a single man of authority in our army who has not personally led men in defense of our country and personally bled upon our country's ground."
 CHI_Send_In_The_Next_Batch:0 "신세대를 전쟁터로"
 CHI_Send_In_The_Next_Batch_desc:0 "The outbreak of bloodshed has necessitated drastically expediting the training of our new officer corps. With any luck, this won't cause us any serious problems: it's better for our new generation of leaders to learn from hands-on experience than from merely a formal education anyway."
 CHI_Extend_Rotation_Cycles:0 "역할교대 기간연장"
 CHI_Extend_Rotation_Cycles_desc:0 "It was hoped that allowing the greatest number of officers possible to participate in combat on as many fronts as possible would widen their experience and make them better able to do their jobs. Instead, it has made them able to get away with not doing their jobs at all. The constant shuffle of officers in and out of positions has made the chain of command itself rust and wither away. If we are to make our army professional, we must lengthen the service of our officers, to ensure that useful men remain in useful positions, and do not waste their accrued experience."
 CHI_Replace_Only_The_Incompetent:0 "무장한 장교만을 교체해라"
 CHI_Replace_Only_The_Incompetent_desc:0 "A competent officer is too rare a commodity to be misused, and an incompetent officer too dangerous a liability to be used at all. Those in our officer corps who have failed to demonstrate the proper qualities of command will be shown the door, their duties fulfilled by their peers who would better live up to the dream of a new, strong China."
 CHI_Emergency_Promotions:0 "고인에 대한 승급예우"
 CHI_Emergency_Promotions_desc:0 "If a man does his job well and the man ahead of him is either dead or deficient, it is criminally irresponsible of us not to promote him. We can respect seniority after we have won the war. For now, any blundering old officers that would impede our progress can be put out to pasture."
 
 CHI_Weapons_Testing:0 "무기 테스트"
 CHI_Weapons_Testing_desc:0 "The weapons we have can do the job, but not especially well. It is overdo for us to begin probing into new equipment that could help make the difference against the rebels. Our engineers will begin testing new weapons and new accoutrements of war, to do their part in aiding the eventual victory of China. If the enemy's weapons are sticks and stones compared to our own armaments, then they cannot hope to ever hold against us."
 CHI_First_Time_Warriors:0 "전사가 되기위한 첫시간"
 CHI_First_Time_Warriors_desc:0 "The men on the ground master the art of war most efficiently through practicing it in the field, not by wasting the war away with such inane things as 'basic training'. Our first time warriors will take the quick approach to learning the way that war is conducted, by experiencing it themselves. I mean, how difficult can it be to point and shoot?"
 CHI_A_Waste_Of_Lead:0 "이유있는 낭비"
 CHI_A_Waste_Of_Lead_desc:0 "Upon the outbreak of conflict in the southwest, it was our priority to ensure that we had a large enough army trained well enough to wage a real war. Now that we are in the midst of things, it is our priority to ensure that we have a large enough army trained well enough to actually win. Starting now, every new soldier coming off the block will be adequately trained and equipped, and any green recruits on the front who have not already died will be called back for additional training. No more will our rifles be a waste of steel and our bullets a waste of lead; the men holding them will find their mark, and China will find its victory."
 CHI_The_Right_Tools_For_The_Job:0 "일을 위한 적절한 도구"
 CHI_The_Right_Tools_For_The_Job_desc:0 "Even as we remain confident in our victory over the Yunnan rebels and their so-called king, we must address materiel problems on the front. The army of China is large and powerful, but many of our men-fearless and heroic as they are-are under equipped. Even many of those who enjoy the privilege of being fully outfitted are forced to make do with outdated scraps, of the sort that other nations might scoff at our using. We had hoped that the zealots we fight would be engaging us with antique equipment, and they are; but sadly, we are too. If China is to find victory then we must produce the best weapons we have to offer, to show the rebels and the wider world our mettle."
 CHI_Practical_Unit_Composition:0 "실용적 단위구성"
 CHI_Practical_Unit_Composition_desc:0 "A modern war requires a modern army. Our units are composed as our generals remember them, as they were in the last war, against the last enemy. But it is a new age, and although Long Yang is an old enemy, there are new enemies waiting on the horizon. We must abandon the military organization of generations past and force modernity at the tip of a bayonet."
 CHI_Fighting_To_Win:0 "승리를 위해 싸워라"
 CHI_Fighting_To_Win_desc:0 "Our days of fighting to survive are finally over. We will no longer hold the rebels at the gates. We will no longer stand our ground. We will no longer allow for the mad dog Long Yun to rule as the self-styled king of OUR Yunnan, and to assault the borders of our China with impunity. We will fight to win: we will take offensive, and push the battle to the doorsteps of the traitors that started this war."
 CHI_We_Have_Work_To_Do:0 "우리가 해야할 일"
 CHI_We_Have_Work_To_Do_desc:0 "The preparations we have made to make our army ready to win this war have only just finished. Now, comes the task of actually winning. It will not just be the enemy's blood that will pool at the feet of our army, but also our soldier's own sweat. The cowards are driven out; the incompetent are replaced; the weapons of war are forged and armed. Now, we must fire, and pray for China's sake that our aim is true."

 CHI_Never_Let_A_Good_Crisis_Go_To_Waste:0 "위기는 위험이자 기회이다"
 CHI_Never_Let_A_Good_Crisis_Go_To_Waste_desc:0 "The unexpected war with Long Yun has taken place under our leadership, and as such we have come under fire as our rivals seek to pin blame onto us. But, even in this chaos we have the opportunity to solidify our control both of the yuan and the peoples hearts and minds. Winning the war will hardly be an issue, our generals are sure of that. What must be focused on is ensuring that we do not let this precious opportunity go to waste. Let slip the hounds of propaganda, Long Yun has done us a favor!"
 CHI_Propaganda:0 "프로파간다"
 CHI_Propaganda_desc:0 "There is a common misconception that all propaganda is lies. In reality it is nothing but the truth, deliberately selected to aid the public interest of victory. For instance, why should the people be shown fleeing soldiers when they could be inspired by heroic stands against the odds? Why distract with useless lists of the dead when estimations of enemy losses are so much better? The real trick is to create the right balance of fear, hatred and pride in the chinese people. All for victory, of course."
 CHI_Slander_Long_Yun:0 "롱원에대한 중상모략"
 CHI_Slander_Long_Yun_desc:0 "Cruel! Despot! Madman! The mad dog of the west! An affront against china and all the good people of asia, that is what Long Yun is. And even if he were not, that is soon what he will become in the minds of the chinese people. One of our artists has hit upon a particularly menacing image, placing Long's face onto an emaciated, drooling wild dog with a dead chicken grasped between its jaws. With President Zongwu's own blessing this is the new face of the enemy, a new face to be feared and hated. Won't you protect from this mad beast?"
 CHI_Anti_Yi_Sentiment:0 "반-이족 감정"
 CHI_Anti_Yi_Sentiment_desc:0 "The Yi people have long lorded over the land to the west, but what many do not know is how disgusting their rule has been. Look over the fields and you will see cruel slavery as Yi landlords beat happless Han into submision. Whether it was Lu Han or Long Yun, it has always been a mean and narrow Yi butcher who lords over the peasant. So, you ask why this war has come to your doorstep? The reason is clear: the Yi, born a cruel and base people, have finally tired of those already toiling under them. Now they come to make slaves of us all and to sate their bloodlust! This war must be won, not only for the freedom of your own people, but for all those under the Yi yoke already."
 CHI_Touring_The_Front_Lines:0 "전선시찰"
 CHI_Touring_The_Front_Lines_desc:0 "While President Zongwu's safety is of course top priority, it would do our moral and our press wonders for Zongwu himself to appear near the fighting. With the wounded and confirming with the generals, it will remind the men that they have not been forgotten, and warn our generals that they have not gone unwatched either. And besides, Zongwu is technically the top of the command chain: it only makes sense that he should be near the fighting. Just not too near."
 CHI_Our_Brave_Young_Men:0 "우리의 용감한 청년들" 
 CHI_Our_Brave_Young_Men_desc:0 "The beasteal energy of masculinity, tempered by the hardness of discipline, put to the greatest service: sacrifice for the chinese nation. Our brave young men, the first and best of china, embody this high ideal to the last, and all young men should be happy to prove themselves in the service of their nation. On posters, on radios and even televisions the iron will and high nobility of the chinese soldier stars out at the chinese man, calling him ever higher, calling him to his destiny: to the battle. And those who would not answer the call to arms? Cowards, worms who can scarcely be called men at all. In battle, you shall prove yourself worthy of you father's legacy and your mother's hopes: become the brave young man!"
 CHI_Posters_On_The_Wall_Flyers_In_Your_Hand:0 "벽에걸린 포스터와 손에든 전단지"
 CHI_Posters_On_The_Wall_Flyers_In_Your_Hand_desc:0 "A man may not be convinced by a single image, and even if he should be only being reminded of the war once a day leave him liable to forget. As such the propaganda office has decided to employ "saturation messaging" to bring the message of the state to its people. Every street will have a poster, every radio message prefaced by a patriotic quip. Wherever you turn in china, or at least in the capital, you shall be met with another affirmation of the glory, righteousness and necessity of this war, and reminded also of every chinese man's duty to support the brave troops giving their all on the front lines, wherever they may be."
 CHI_Patriotic_News_From_The_Front:0 "전선으로부터온 애국적인 뉴스"
 CHI_Patriotic_News_From_The_Front_desc:0 "Sadly we are not the only source of news which the chinese man may go to. Rags and rumor mills have disrupted the mindset we have so carefully chosen to cultivate despite our efforts. As such President Zongwu has declared new restrictions against those liars who would contradict the news our patriotic correspondents have given to us, and organized a new stamp of approval: News From the Front! When the people either see or hear this they shall know that this is, without a doubt, the truth of the situation, as guaranteed by those who are best placed to know."
 CHI_For_China:0 "중국을 위하여!"
 CHI_For_China_desc:0 "The Propaganda machine has done its work masterfully. Enthusiasm for the war has never been higher and it seems that the chinese people are at long last beginning to find their spine once again. Young men no longer run from the sound of marching, nor do rumor mills sabotage the war effort with any success. With the image of the ideal soldier and the worst enemy dancing before our eyes the Western War shall be won not simply by superior weapons or numbers but the only way anything is ever won: the superior fighting spirit of the people!"
 CHI_The_Commitee_Of_Pan_Asian_Unity:0 "범-아시아 안보위"
 CHI_The_Commitee_Of_Pan_Asian_Unity_desc:0 "The government of China has finally announced the founding of the Pan-Asian Security Council. This will be the government's primal weapon against the traitors inside of China, while the army fights in the borders. If we will secure Chinese people from Japanese, we have to first secure Chinese from other Chinese."

If we will secure Chinese people from Japanese, we have to first secure Chinese from other Chinese."
 CHI_Purge_The_Commitee:0 "위원회 내부 숙청"
 CHI_Purge_The_Commitee_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that if we desire a pure and secure committee to purge the traitors in China, we must make sure that the committee is we must take measures to make sure the ones we are purging aren't the ones doing the purging. We have to purge the committee from unwanted and dangerous thoughts. If we fail to, our state may find itself at ends with our Pan-Asian allies, something wholly undesirable."
 CHI_Defer_To_The_Experts:0 "해당 전문가에게 일임"
 CHI_Defer_To_The_Experts_desc:0 "It is a great idea to bring in "the experts" to the war against Yunnan. Loyal army officers and political theorists will help us in this cursed war, surely. We only have to know which words we'll choose to sway them. And than, the domino will fall upon the Yunnan. We shall never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception. Because it is much safer to be feared than be loved."
 CHI_Sorting_The_Reports:0 "기밀 분류"
 CHI_Sorting_The_Reports_desc:0 "Our Committee is doing pretty well, even better than we expected. But we have noticed that a lot of the files are non classified. This will surely result in a confusion amongst our committee members. However, one of our committee members have come to us with a bright idea. If we sort our reports with classes, we might focus on more important figures before we deal with the less important traitors. Such a great idea would only came from our state as expected."
 CHI_Keep_A_Steady_Hand:0 "한결같은 손길로"
 CHI_Keep_A_Steady_Hand_desc:0 "As the war continues, the confidence in the committee declines. We have to do something about this, perhaps a moral boost will solve this ridiculous issue. We also have to keep an eye on the Gongbo Clique. It is not a secret that they want to unite the whole of Asia under Japanese. Such a degrading thought shouldn't rule China. And we have to make sure that they don't rule. Anything can happen to our country, and we think it will not be good for the people. That's why we have to do whatever must be done and end this low morality before it begins."

 ###Gongbo Tree

 CHI_New_Modernization:0 "A New Modernization"
 CHI_New_Modernization_desc:0 "The presidency of Gao Zongwu built its foundation on the grounds of ushering in a new age for China. The flagship set of programs known as the fiver modernizations had noble intentions, obviously China should be a nation to be envied. Where Mr. Gao failed, however, is in the execution. Where Gao would expel the Japanese, diplomatically isolating our nation and denying our flowering nation any aid, Gongbo works with those who work with China."
 CHI_Revitalization:0 "Revitalization"
 CHI_Revitalization_desc:0 "Instability comes a dime a dozen in China. Failures of the imperial dynasties, the fracturing of Chaing's government into warlord states, the loss in the Sino-Japanese war, and now the end of the reign of Gao. China has suffered long enough, this much consensus can be reached between the Gaoists and the new government. At this point in time, China cannot carry the burden of curing her ailments alone. With due assistance from Japan, the Chinese industry will receive the shock to return to profits, to return to stability for the first time in centuries."
 CHI_Reject_Zongwu:0 "Reject Gao Zongwu Thought"
 CHI_Reject_Zongwu_desc: "While Gao may no longer stand at the helm of China, his specter haunts China. Frankly, the people of China were hopeless and Gao offered them a new start, a new China. The ideas of the late president garnered the attention of the people, earning him the title of savior. It won't be easy to root out the influence of Gao Zongwu but we can begin by pointing out the flaws in his thought and flaunting the effects of our policies."
 CHI_Cancel_the_Expansions:0 "Cancel the Expansions"
 CHI_Cancel_the_Expansions_desc:0 "Sickening information found from the pillaging of Gao's office shows that the expansions of the military budget was not simply for the defense of the state, but for offensive use, against our own allies no less! Wasteful spending in times where Yen is fleeting is treason enough but sanctioning an army purely for plunging Asia into chaos justifies our actions.\n\nFor all his talk of bringing the Chinese market into the modern age and ensuring equal access to education, much of the budget had been directed towards the army. President Gongbo's vision is one of internal improvement, not of creating conflict."
 CHI_Buy_Chinese:0 "Buy Chinese!"
 CHI_Buy_Chinese_desc:0 "Failure. Total industrial failure. There is not much more that can be said of the economic policy of the previous government. Too much emphasis was placed on the west, meanwhile China stood high and dry, neglected by her own government who was too busy chasing the dreams of mimicking the nations that lead to China's humiliation. Goods made in China should be the envy of our nation, not second hand garbage. Government subsidies into local businesses will ensure the nation flourishes."
 CHI_Fat_Trim:0 "Trim the Fat"
 CHI_Fat_Trim_desc:0 "Helpless, the people of China were forced to watch the pathetic dance of the stock exchange. A beautiful crescendo, profits soaring. Then, the ungraceful fall, suddenly all the hard work evaporated at the whim of a businessman hundreds of kilometers away. In these trials and tribulations China is subjected too, the wallet must be held tight and only in specific circumstances should we break the piggy bank. Reallocating funds away from the wasteful programs established under Gao and putting that back in the hands of the people will provide the jumpstart needed for our economy to take off."
 CHI_Austerity_Ship:0 "Austerity Steers the Ship"
 CHI_Austerity_Ship_desc:0 "China is not the empire of gold and silk anymore. Frankly, we don't have the capital to move around to keep afloat all of Zongwu's programs. There are many issues plaguing China that could be fixed if only we had the money, regrettably, we don't and there's no magic money tree of which we can harvest.\n\nThe unfathomable amount of debt owed to Japan among other nations must be addressed before we can consider tackling smaller issues."
 CHI_All_of_China:0 "All of China, Together!"
 CHI_All_of_China_desc:0 "The people of China are no stranger to division. Few remember the days when China was united and feared. For many, a fractured China is but a simple fact of life, this doesn't have to be the fate of the Middle Kingdom.\n\nThe disparity between the wealthy and densely populated cities of eastern China and the rural villages of central and western China does nothing to alleviate the effects of the dying Chinese identity. Many feel completely abandoned by our government, we can remind them that China is one nation, composed of one Chinese people by giving eastern prosperity to the west."
 CHI_Not_Alone:0 "Why Work Alone?"
 CHI_Not_Alone_desc:0 "Subsidizes, employment, and protection, what more can be offered to us? Our brothers have shook us awake from the nightmare of the end of an Asian identity in favor of a western one, only for Gao and his cronies to bite at the hand that feeds us! Under different circumstances, Gao's foolish policies may have stood to benefit the nation but we do not have the resources to overhaul the nation all our one. If Japan is offering, we ought to accept. A stronger China, a stronger Asia, together."
 CHI_Import_Labor:0 "Import Labor"
 CHI_Import_Labor_desc:0 "Despite the overwhelming population of China, a sizable portion of the population can work in the factories of the modern world. The ever innovating world does not wait for China to pick herself up, if we are to remain competitive, we'll need to welcome foreign labor, not shun it. Not only are these guest workers prepared to deal with the standards of many businesses, they aren't in a position to demand too much for pay."
 CHI_Art_Deal:0 "Art of the Deal"
 CHI_Art_Deal_desc:0 "For all of Gao's experience as a diplomat, the Chinese nation saw the fruits of his expertise. One would assume that someone with a background in working specifically with Japan would have no trouble forging a healthy relationship with the prominent Asian power. Then again, it was Gao who attempted to negotiate a peace at the start of the war, and we are very well aware of how that turned out. Shunning the major powers of the era set back China for years, now all we can hope to do is alleviate the fallout.\n\nRestablishing our position in the Sphere should be our top priority. Although they may have their reservations, all we have to do is show them China is open for business."
 CHI_Import_Quotas:0 "Import Quotas"
 CHI_Import_Quotas_desc:0 "As part of our doctrine of pan-asian brotherhood and cooperation, our senior diplomats spend their restless nights on the phone with officials from our neighbors, ironing out deals. While most terms are open to compromise, one thing is set in stone; all Sphere nations must reach a quota of Chinese imports for continued partnership. As the second most prominent power in Asia, our brothers would be wise to maintain close ties, and in order to do so, the goods must flow."
 CHI_Chinese_Zaibatsu:0 "The Chinese Zaibatsu"
 CHI_Chinese_Zaibatsu_desc:0 "Looking back at the rapid rise of Japan, many factors contributed to the success over the colonizers and the power to persist to this day as an equal. Japan earned her spot at the negotiating table with her military power but the Japanese have mastered the market unlike no other. This success can be attributed to the mega conglomerates of the Zaibatsus, who instead of bickering and fighting against each other, merge into one powerful entity for total control over the economy. Seeing as this economic status has been proven successful, compiling major businesses into one will push us over the edge into success."
 CHI_Bankruptcy:0 "Preferential Bankruptcy"
 CHI_Bankruptcy_desc:0 "Mismanagement and lack of opportunity clips the wings of prospecting businesses hoping to take flight, forcing many into bankruptcy. When these start up companies fall apart, the vulchers circling the corpse strike and pick at the remains, a free for all for the leftovers. It isn't practical to prop up every business but we can assure that these entrepreneurs who start in Asia, stay in Asia. By ensuring Chinese and Japanese companies have first grabs, we can minimize the amount of business lost to the west."
 CHI_River_Rights:0 "Rights on the River"
 CHI_River_Rights_desc:0 "The vast swaths of territory managed by our government encompass a wide variety of terrains: hills and valleys, grasslands and wetlands, deserts and fertile fields scattered across the Middle Kingdom. Having such a massive state can makecommerence and governing a challenge. Luckily, the Yangtze and Haihe act as natural links between the isolated villages and the metropolises. Placing control over these vital waterways firmly in the hands of Chinese and Japanese industry solidifies our dominance in the region."
 CHI_Pop_Exchange:0 "Population Exchanges"
 CHI_Pop_Exchange_desc:0 "Asia is a collection of many people. The Han Chinese, the Thai, Rohingya, the Aceh, and so many more. Above all else, above petty lines on a map, Asia is a collection of one people. One people with equal rights to live, work, and to explore their home. The people of China are encouraged to see all that Asia has to offer them, and bring their distinct culture with them. While our door is wide open, the best and brightest will flock to China in search of opportunity."
 CHI_Pan_Asianist_Society:0 "A Pan-Asianist Society"
 CHI_Pan_Asianist_Society_desc:0 "Asia squirmed under the boot of imperialism for too long. Even when western powers pitted us against each other for their own profit and prestige, we remained divided. The cold splash of water delivered from Japan has woken us up to our surroundings. Japan has fostered something beautiful, and the disgusting rats of the Zongwu wing of government seek to undermine our Asain brotherhood. The Chinese people have stood up to this, proclaiming that now more than ever, the defeat of the west is within our grasp.\n\nWe have proven our self as a steadfast ally to all who call Asia their home and we will defend Asia at any cost!"
 CHI_Only_Way:0 "It Was the Only Way"
 CHI_Only_Way_desc:0 "Things have calmed down. The streets of Nanjing bustle with traffic, the people finally have jobs. The economy has found its footing. We have found our groove undoubtably, but in this quiet and oh so rare moment of stability, we are left with time to reflect. What brought us to this point in time? All the difficult choices and blood spilled all for this, for peace. Was there any other way we could've arrived at this point?"
 CHI_Right_Thing:0 "We Did the Right Thing"
 CHI_Right_Thing_desc:0 "No. There was no alternative. It is a pleasant thought that perhaps Gao, for all his shortcomings and failures, would admire the work we have accomplished here. We have built a nation to be proud of, all while making the unpopular decisions. Peering over the skyline from the capital, one can see the bustling markets, the smell of a smog in the air, and people across Asia working in harmony. We have nothing to be ashamed of."

 CHI_We_Need_Ammo_desc:0 "No modern war can be won without weapons and ammunition; a seemingly-easy to understand lesson, which we did not follow in the past and led to a host of humiliations.

 CHI_We_Need_Allies_desc:0 "We may have the courage, but courage alone did not save us back in the 1940s, and prior to that. To finally cast off the yoke of the Wa, we need allies, from near and far. Surely, East Asia and beyond would have an interest in seeing the Japanese Hydra weakened, or?"
 CHI_Fire_Up_The_Factories:0 "Fire Up The Factories!"
 CHI_Fire_Up_The_Factories_desc:0 "Our industry, while meager, must follow its nation and focus itself on one goal: victory. Be it via producing weaponry and armaments or via helping build new factories for the war effort, or even via simple production of leaflets, our factories face a big challenge. One which they must succeed in or be destroyed."
 CHI_Patriotic_Mobilization_Efforts:0 "Patriotic Mobilization Efforts"
 CHI_Patriotic_Mobilization_Efforts_desc:0 "Souls, not just bodies, must be mobilized in order for victory to be achieved.
